    6.  FOR ALL ERROR STOPS THE BEAT ADDRESS IS LOCATED IN STORAGE AT
        LOCATIONS 0154 FOR 9S03 H OR 17754 FOR 9S03 L. TO RESTART, PUSH START
        BUTTON.

E.  COMMENTS

    1.  THE PROGRAM STORES ZEROS IN EVERY POSITION IN STORAGE EXCLUDING THE
        PROGRAM AREA WHICH CONTAINS THE TEST. EACH ADDRESS IN TURN IS WRITTEN
        WITH A TEST WORD A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN 16 ADDRESSES ARE CHECKED TO
        SEE IF THEY STILL RETAIN ZERO. THE 16 ADDRESSES WHICH ARE CHECKED ARE
        THOSE MOST LIKELY TO PICK UP A BIT DURING WRITE TIME. THEY ARE THE CORES
        SHARING THE SAME SELECT LINE AS THE TEST ADDRESS AND ALSO SHARING THE
        SELECT LINES WHICH CONTAIN NOISE FROM THE CORE DRIVERS AT WRITE TIME.
        UNDER SENSE SWITCH CONTROL IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT EACH ADDRESS 20, 100,
        OR 500 TIMES.

    2.  THE SPEED OF THE PROGRAM IS 7 MINUTES PER PASS WHEN RUN WITH SENSE
        SWITCHES 4 AND 5 UP-20 BEATS PER ADDRESS, AND USING THE TEST WORD
         10101010101. THIS TEST WORD WILL CAUSE EVERY CORE TO BE TESTED 6 TIMES
        IN A COMPLETE PASS.

    3.  THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER A CHOICE IN THE
        METHOD OF TESTING THE MACHINE. THE TEST WORD CAN BE CHANGED AND THE
        ROTATION COUNT CAN BE CHANGED TO SATISFY ANY CONDITIONS.
            EXAMPLE             A.  TO TEST EACH CORE ONLY ONE TIME IS A
                                    COMPLETE PASS USING TEST WORD 010101010101,
                                    PUT 6 IN LOCATION A9. THIS WILL REQUIRE
                                    APPROXIMATELY 1-1/2 MINUTES TO MAKE A

                                                           9S03HA-LA
                                                           7-01-58
                                                           PAGE 1.003

                                    COMPLETE PASS.

                                B.  FOR MAXIMUM SPEED, ALTHOUGH MAYBE NOT THE
                                    WORST TEST, PUT 1 IN LOCATION A9 AND
                                    377777777777 IN LOCATION A1.

    4.  THE CONSTANT AT A9 - LOCATION 0172 OR 17767 - WAS CHOSEN AS 44 TO INSURE
        THAT EVERY CORE IS BEAT FOR ANY TEST PATTERN. ANY TEST PATTERN CAN BE
        USED AT A1, LOCATION 0174 OR 17771 - TO TEST STORAGE. IF ONLY ONE BINARY
        BIT EXISTS IN THE TEST WORD AT A1 -  A NUMBER 1 AT A1 - ALL CORES WILL BE
        TESTED EXCEPT THE SIGN POSITIONS OF EACH WORD, THEREFORE, IT IS
        RECOMMENDED THAT THE TEST WORD AT A1, SHOULD ALWAYS CONTAIN AT LEAST TWO
        BINARY BITS. A NUMBER SUCH AS 100001 AT A1, TO INSURE THAT THE SIGN
        POSITIONS ARE ALWAYS CHECKED.

    5.  9S03 H WILL TEST 1,2, OR 4 737 CORE STORAGES. IT WILL LOAD INTO
        THE LOWEST STORAGE POSITIONS. IT THEN TESTS FOR THE SIZE OF STORAGE
        AND AJUSTS THE ADDRESSES ACCORDINGLY. THE TEST WILL WIPE OUT THE PARTS
        OF THE PROGRAM WHICH TESTS FOR SIZE OF STORAGE.

        9S03 L CAN BE USED WITH ANY NUMBER OF 737 CORE STORAGES, HOWEVER,
        IT WILL TEST ONLY ONE OR TWO CORE STORAGES. IT WILL LOAD INTO THE
        HIGHEST STORAGE POSITIONS OF EITHER ONE OR TWO CORE STORAGES.

    6.  THE PROGRAM WRITES OVER THE TEST FOR SIZE OF STORAGE ON THE FIRST PASS.
        IF A RESTART IS DESIRED IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM A MANUAL TRANSFER
        TO 0000 OT 17600.
