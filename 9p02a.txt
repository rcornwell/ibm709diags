               716 PRINTER INTERROW TIMING TEST


A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   1. This test is designed to measure the interrow timings on the 716 Print.
      These timings are derived from the Master Circuit Breakers and will
      give an indication of the stability of these breakers.

   2. \UA REGULAR RUNNING OF THIS TEST IS REQUIRED.\u Interpretation
      of the printouts will show up potential troubles before errors actually
      occur on the printer.  The timing chart shown gives ideal timings and
      should be used only as a guide for interpretation of the printouts.

B. METHOD OF TEST

   1. The address register of the DSU steps each time a word is sent to the
      printer.  By means of a storage channel instruction in DSU can be
      interrogated to keep track of the address register.  A pre-calculated
      delay gets the program within range of the expected left time, then a
      series of store channel instructions are used to detect when the address
      register steps.  A count of the store channels is kept for calculations.

      The printer and the program are synchronized by the occurrence of 9
      left and tend to run together except when the DSU is using storage to
      extract a word.  During this time the printer gets ahead of the program.
      but this is accounted for in the program by decreasing the increment each
      pass and adding the delay during calculations.

C. AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED


   1. Units - MF, any size CF, CR, DS, PR

   2. Storage - 00000-00523
      and LOC. 777777 or 17777

      Regular Diagnostic Board

   3. Sense Switches
        
      a)   SSW 1 to 5    Not used
           SSW 6 UP      Halts at end of test
           SSW 6 DOWN    Repeat test

E. NORMAL STOPS

      00146  Stops at end of test if sense switch 6 is UP.
             Press start to repeat test.

F. ERROR STOPS
 
      00066  Indicates accumulator is higher than storage 
             channel and compare loop. Possible DSU trouble.  Restart
             program; if stop reoccurs run appropriate diagnostics.

G. PRINTOUTS

       Normal printouts will be as in the sample.  The first eleven lines
       contain no information other than they are the printouts from which
       the timings occurred.

       The next eleven lines contain the timigns in microseonds from 9 left
       to the other left timings. (See sample printout).  The timing between
       9 left and 8 left is 16,572 microseconds or, if the decimal is moved
       left three places, it would be 16.572 milliseconds.

H. COMMENTS

   1.  The only subroutine used in this test is "SPLAT" which is called in
       to convert timings to decimal and printout timing information.
      
   2.  Diagnostic Engineering would appreciate reports on the results of
       this test.  Any suggestions for improvement or any peculiar conditions
       which this test shows up are of interest to Diagnostic Engineering.
      
   3.  While running this test on printers being final tested, it was noted
       that the timings increased beyond theoretical timings as the speed of
       the printer decreased and as the printer speed increased the timings
       dropped below theoretical timings. If timing differ widely from
       theoretical, it is suggested that the sped of the machine be checked.
