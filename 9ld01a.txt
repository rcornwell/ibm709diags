	 	    EXPLANATION OF OPERATION

THIS LOAMR WAS WRITTEN TO USE AS LITTLE OF THE CIRCUITRY AS POSSIBLE AND
STILL COMPARE THE CHECK SUMS.

THE CONTROL WORD FOR THE LOADER USES ONLY S TRIGGER, AS DOES THE LOAD
CARD BUTTON, THEREFORE. IF THE BUTTON IS OPERATING CORRECTLY THE PROGRAM
SHOULD LOAD. 

NO INDEXING IS USED THROUGHOUT THE LOADER. THE MAIN FRAME INSTRUCTIONS
USED ARE LISTED BELOW.

		CLA		 STA		 SLW
		TZE		 CAL		 SUB
		ST0		 ACL		 TMI

THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY BE ELIMINATED BY IGNORING A CHECK SUM COMPARISON,
AND TRANSFERRING MANUALLY, THE LOADER WILL THEN EXECUTE ONLY THREE 
INSTRUCTIONS, RCDA, RCHA AND TCOA. TO DO THIS PLACE A TRA TO 0001 AT
LOCATION 0004, FOR 9LDOl OR TRA TO 77751 AT LOCATION 71754 FOR 9LD02. IF A
MANUAL TRANSFER IS UNDESIRABLE PLACE A TRA TO 1 AT LOCATION 0006, FOR 9LD01
OR TRA TO 77751 AT LOCATION 77756, FOR 9LD02

THE CONSTANT AT LOCATION 0023 OR 77773, WHEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE 9L WORD-
LOCATION 0026 OR 77776-WILL DECREASE THE DECREMENT-WORD COUNT-BY 1 AND
INCREASE THE ADDRESS-INITIAL ADDRESS-BY 1. AFTER THE WORD COUNT IN THE
DECREMENT OF 9L HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 0, ALL WORDS WILL HAVE BEEN READ INTO
THE CORRECT LOCATIONS, AND THE NEXT SUBTRACTION WILL CHANGE THE
ACCUMULATOR TO MINUS. THE CHECK SUMS WILL THEN BE COMPARED AT LOCATIONS
0017 - 0021 OR 77767 - 77771.

LOCATIONS 0006 - 0016 OR 77756 - 77766 CONSTRUCT THE CHECK SUM,

LOCATIONS 0026 - 0027 OR 77776 - 77777 HOLD THE 9L AND 9R WORDS OF EACH
CARD. 9L DECREMENT CONTAINING THE NUMBER OF WORDS ON THE CARD AND 9L
AODRESS CONTAINING THE INITIAL ADDRESS. 9R CONTAINS THE CHECK SUM OF THE
CARD BEING READ.

THIS LOADER USES A SPECIAL TRA CARD WHICH MAY NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER
LOADER, NOR WILL THE LOADER READ ANY OTHER TRA CARD.
9L OF THE TRA CARD IS BLANK, AND 9R CONTAINS A PLUS TRA TO THE STARTING
ADDRESS OF THE PROGRAM BEING LOADED.
