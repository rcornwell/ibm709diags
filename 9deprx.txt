SENSE SWITCH INTERROGATION AND DIAGNOSTIC PRINT SUBROUTINE



A.   PURPOSE OF THIS SUBROUTINE

     This subroutine under control of the SENSE SWITCHES will:
     
     1.    Print out the status of the machine at the time of error.  The
           printout will provide information which is useful when running
           diagnostic programs.
         
     2.    Check for a TAPE REDUNDANCY on all CHANNELS.
         
     3.    Provide for looping in any section of the main program.
         
         
B.   METHOD OF TEST

     This subroutine may be used only with programs which have provided
     the basic linkage to the subroutine.
     
     1.    Insert a BCD word of SHARE MNEMONICS OPERATION CODE at
           the beginning of each section of a program to indicate what operation
           is being tested.
        
           Immediately folloowing this BCD word will be the first instruction
           of the section being tested.  This instrcutipn is in location X
           referred to in the entries.
        
                    Example:
     
                                   BCD     1CLA
                          X        CLA      AAA
        
     2.    The basic linkage to the subroutine will depend on what type of
           printout or checking is desired.
        
     3.    6 Entries are available to this subroutine.  Purpose and Linkage
           to each entry are described on subsequent pages of this write-up.

                  TSX  OK,4
                  TRA  X
     
           This ENTRY causes a FOUR LINE MAIN FRAME printout as
           shown on page 1.008.  Return is made to 2 instructions following
           TRA X.  If SENSE SWITCH 1 is DOWN, return is made to TRA
           X which will cause a repeat of the section being tested.  Entry
           to TSX OK,4 will allow for checking SENSE SWITCHES to
           determine whether to repeat the section of program or continue
           with the next section.

           If SENSE SWITCH 4 is DOWN, the tested section will be repeated
           the number of times stored in KONST+2.  Initially this is 40
           DECIMAL but can be changed by storing the desired constant in
           KONST+1 & KONST+2.

           Return is made to 1 instruction: following TRA X.
     
           If SENSE SWITCH 1 is DOWN, return is made to TRA X
           which will cause a repeat of the section being tested.
     
           SENSE SWITCH 4 is not interrogated.

            all CHANNELS. If any tape indicator is on a TWO LINE
            printout will occur as shown on Page 1.009.
     
            Return will be to the instruction following TRA  X.
     
            If SENSE SWITCHES 1 and 2 are DOWN no printout will occur
            and return will be made to TRA X, which will cause a repeat
            of the section begin tested.  With only SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN,
            a printout will occur and the section will be repeated.

             number of times.  With SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN, the section
             will be repeated until SENSE SWITCH 1 is RAISED. With
             SENSE SWITCH 1 UP and SENSE SWITCH 4 DOWN, the program
             section will loop the number of times specified in KONST+2.  This
             is 40 DECIMAL times initially but can be changed by storing desired
             constant in KONST+1 & KONST+2.  SENSE SWITCHES 1 and 4 UP,
             the program section will not be repeated.

               This entry and it's returns are the same as TSX ERROR-1,4.
               The printout however is a 4 line I/O printout as shown on

     4.                TRA   X  OR   TXL   X
     
          In TRA X, the X denotes the starting instruction of the section
          being tested.
     
          If the TRA X is changed to TXL X only one line will be printed
          when an error occurs.  See Page 1.009
     
     5.              TXL   X,4
     
          If TXL X is given a Tag of 4, the instruction will be treated as a
          NOP.
     
     
     6.           ETT
     
          An error track identification has been incorporated into this sub-
          routine.  A typical printout is shown on Page 1.009.
     
          This routine will provide identification for tracks on which errors
          have occurred.  This routine is called in by using the basic I/O
          linkage and inserting a 1 in the DECREMENT of the TSX instruction.
     
              Example:
     
                      TSX  ERROR-2,4,1
                      TRA  X
     
            The printout provided is useful on tape comparison errors but is
            meaningless when called in on card machine comparison errors.

     7.     When writing an I/O test, prior to entering this subroutine:
     
            Store the WORD COUNT of each RECORD in INDEX REGISTER A.
            Store the RECORD COUNT in INDEX REGISTER B.
            Store the TOTAL WORD COUNT +1 in "WDNO"
            Store the TOTAL RECORD COUNT +1 in "RECNO"
     
     8.     If a section of the program uses the TRAPPING MODE, the BCD
            word at the start of the section should be followed by a hyphen.
     
                 Example:
    
                            BCD    1CLA-

                                 indicates that the SWITCH is UP and a 1 indicates
                                 that the SWITCH is DOWN.  SENSE SWITCHES and
                                 SENSE LIGHTS are read sequentially from LEFT TO

                                only if it is called in by the TSX instruction.

             When SENSE SWITCH 3 is DOWN the MQ will contain the CORRECT
