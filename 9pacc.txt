                          B/M-564821, E. C.-298613-A

    THIS PROGRAM UP DATES 9PACB TO ACCOMODATE AND TEST CLOCKS CONNECTED
    TO BOTH THE 709 AND THE 7090.

A.  UNIT TESTED

    THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING CLOCK FEATURE OF THE 716 PRINTER.

    1.  METHOD
 
        THE CLOCK IS TESTED BY READING INTO THE CLOCK WITH WRS OR RDS, AND
        THEN READING OUT THE CLOCK WITH RDS AND ECHO CHECKING.

        THE BCD PRINT SUBROUTINE -SPLAT- IS USED FOR PRINTING, IT IS LOCATED
        AT 6500. ALSO A SPECIAL CONTROL PANEL FOR THE PRINTER IS REQUIRED.

    2.  MONITOR

        WHEN THE PROGRAM BEGINS, ALL UNUSED PORTIONS OF CORE STORAGE,
        REGARDELESS OF SIZE, ARE FILLED WITH A TSX INSTRUCTION. IF
        THE PROGRAM SKIPS WILDLY INTO SPACE, OR IF THE PROGRAM GOES OUT
        OF SEQUENCE, THE MONITOR CAN RECOVER CONTROL.

B.  AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

    1.  MAIN FRAME, CORE, CARD READER, 716 PRINTER WITH THE CLOCK FEATURE.

    2.  STORAGE LOCATIONS

        ALL OF CORE STORAGE IS USED BY MONITOR.

C.  PROGRAM CONTROL

                     053-054        BLANK CARDS

    2.  SENSE SWITCHES

        SWITCH 1.   DOWN - REPEAT ROUTINE
                    UP   - DO NOT REPEAT ROUTINE
        SWITCH 2.   DOWN - SKIP ERROR CHECKS
                    UP   - PERFORM ERROR CHECKS AND HALT ON ERROR
        SWITCH 3.   NOT USED
                    
        SWITCH 4.   DOWN - CONTINUE MANUAL CONTROL COUNTING
                    UP   - CEASE COUNTING
        SWITCH 5.   DOWN - GO TO MANUAL ENTRY ROUTINE
                    UP   - NO ACTION

        SWITCH 6.   DOWN - REPEAT PROGRAM
                    UP   - SELECT CARD READER AT END OF PROGRAM PASS

    3.  KEYS

        THE TIMING LOOPS IN THE PROGRAM MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FIT THE
        CLOCK AND CALCULATOR IN USE.  TO DO THIS AN ENTRY MUST BE MADE
        ON KEYS S, 1 AND 2 AS FOLLOWS---

                      .01 MIN .1 MIN  .01 HOUR
              7090    000     010     001
              709     100     110     101

        NOTICE THAT IF NO ENTRY IS MADE, THE PROGRAM WILL BE SET FOR THE
        .01 MINUTE CLOCK ATTACHED TO THE 7090.  THIS ENTRY MUST BE MADE
        WHEN YOU START THE PROGRAM.


D.  NORMAL STOPS

    1213    ILLEGAL KEY ENTRY.  PRINTER WILL PRINT REMARK.

    1232    INCORRECT PRINTER BOARD.  THE PRINTER WILL PRINT A REMARK.

                    SEE DIAGRAM FOR THE WIRING OF THE BOARD

    1067    MANUAL CONTROL COUNT TEST-THE PRINTER WILL PRINT INSTRUCTIONS.
            TO COUNT, PUT DOWN SWITCH 4 AND PRESS START. THE CLOCK WILL BE
            RESET AND WILL START COUNTING WHEN LIGHT 4 GOES ON. COUNTING
            WILL CONTINUE UNTIL SWITCH 4 IS PUT UP, AT WHICH TIME THE CLOCK
            VALUE IS PRINTED AND THE PROGRAM PROCEEDS TO TEST SWITCHES 1 AND 6.
            THE CLOCK SHOULD COUNT 10 TIMES EACH 6 SECONDS. THIS TEST IS
            PERFORMED ON THE FIRST PROGRAM PASS ONLY, IT IS SKIPPED ON
            EACH SUCCEEDING PASS UNLESS MANUAL TRANSFER IS MADE TO IT.

    1234    MANUAL ENTRY TEST.
            THIS TEST IS ENTERED IF SWITCH 5 IS DOWN WHEN THE PROGRAM BEGINS
            AT 30. PUT INTO THE KEYS THE NUMBER YOU WISH TO BE READ INTO THE
            CLOCK IN BCD, PRESS START, AND OBSERVE THE PRINTER. THE NUMBER
            WILL BE READ OUT TO THE CLOCK AND ECHO CHECKED. HALT WILL OCCUR
            IF SWITCH 1 IS UP, YOU MAY THEN ENTER A NEW VALUE, OR PRESS START
            TO REPEAT. ANY ERROR INDICATIONS ARE PRINTED ON THE PRINTER IF
            SWITCH 2 IS UP. IF SWITCH 1 IS DOWN, THE ROUTINE WILL REPEAT
            NON-STOP UNDER SWITCH 2 CONTROL. THE ONLY WAY TO EXIT FROM THIS
            ROUTINE AND RETURN TO THE MAIN PROGRAM IS TO PUT UP SWITCH 5,
            AND THE PRESS RESET AND START.

E.  ERROR STOPS
    
        EACH ROUTINE HAS ITS OWN ERROR STOPS, AND ALL ERROR CONDITIONS ARE
        PRINTED ON THE PRINTER.

F.  PRINT OUTS

        EVERY ROUTINE PRINTS OUT ITS INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS.

G.  COMMENTS.

        SKIP TO ONE IS EXECUTED TO EMPHASIZE INFORMATION PRINTED ON ERROR
        CONDITION, MANUAL COUNT TEST, AND END OF PROGRAM PASS.

EXAMPLE OF PRINT-OUT

         000000 TO READ IN TO CLOCK.
                  READ BACK FROM CLOCK TO CHECK.        CLOCK VALUE - - - 000000

EXAMPLE OF ERROR

         111111 TO READ IN TO CLOCK.
                  READ BACK FROM CLOCK TO CHECK.        CLOCK VALUE - - - 111181
                  READ BACK...111181 SHOULD HAVE BEEN 111111.
