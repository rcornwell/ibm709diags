              SPECIAL RIPPLES AND SPECIAL RANDOM NUMBERS PATTERNS


A.  UNIT TESTED

    1.  PURPOSE

        TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS TEST FOR THE 721 CARD PUNCH.

    2.  METHOD OF TEST

        A RIGOROUS TEST HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY USING THREE SPECIAL
        RIPPLE PATTERNS AND SIX SPECIAL RANDOM NUMBERS PATTERNS.

        A RANDOM START-STOP OR LATCH-UP PUNCHING CONDITION HAS BEEN GIVEN
        SPECIAL ATTENTION.

        PROVISION IS MADE FOR PUNCHING ANY SPECIAL PATTERN CARD.

        A BIAS TEST OF NINETY SIX CARDS HAS BEEN SET UP UNDER SENSE
        SWITCH FIVE CONTROL.

        THE PROGRAM USES 9DEPRA PRINT ROUTINE AND WILL PRINT OUT PUNCHING
        ERRORS WHEN READING AND CHECKING THE PUNCHED CARDS.

        THE TEST CONSISTS OF THREE MAIN PARTS

        PART 1        MAIN TEST -300 CARDS- 9 PATTERNS 0103-1412

            THIS TEST IS ENTERED WITH SSW 5 UP WHEN LOADING PROGRAM AND
            AT ANY OTHER TIME BY TRANSFERRING TO 0030. IT IS ALSO ENTERED
            BY PUSHING START FROM ANY HTR LOCATION FOLLOWING THE READING
            PART OF EITHER OF THE THREE MAIN TESTS. SSW 6 BEING DOWN AND
            5 UP.

            THIS TEST IS MADE UP OF 9 PATTERNS.

            WHEN ALL PATTERNS ARE PUNCHED, PROGRAM STOPS AT 620. TRANSFER
            CARDS TO READER, FOLLOW WITH TWO BLANKS. READY READER AND
            PUSH START TO READ AND COMPARE PUNCHED CARDS.

   0103 -   PATTERN ONE  --  IS A 12 CARD SEMI-HEAVY RIPPLE PATTERN WITH

                                                                     9R01A
                                                                     11/1/58
                                                                     PAGE 1.003

                             EVEN ROWS BEING ZERO AND ODD ROWS BEING
                             FULLY PUNCHED EXCEPT FOR ONE MOVING POSITION.
                             THIS PATTERN IS A RIDGID TEST FOR THE PUNCH DIES.

   0154 -   PATTERN TWO  --  IS A 72 CARD LIGHT RIPPLE PATTERN WHICH PUNCHES
                             ONE PUNCH, AND ONLY ONE, IN EACH ROW, EXCEPT
                             THE 12 ROW, FOR EVERY CARD PUNCHED. THESE
                             POSITIONS ARE SHIFTED UNTIL EVERY COLUMN OF
                             EVERY ROW HAS BEEN PUNCHED.  THIS PATTERN IS A
                             RIDGID TEST FOR THE PUNCH MAGNETS.

   0223 -   PATTERN THREE -- IS A 72 CARD HEAVY RIPPLE PATTERN FOR ROWS
                             9,6,3, AND 0. ALL OTHERS ROWS ARE ZEROED.
                             ROWS 9,6,3, AND 0 ARE FULLY PUNCHED SAVE ONE
                             POSITION WHICH MOVES THROUGH THE 72 COLUMNS.
                             THIS PATTERN IS RIDGID TEST FOR THE PUNCH
                             MAGNETS AND ALSO THE WRITE THYRATRONS.

           THE NEXT SIX PATTERNS ARE SPECIALLY PREPARED RANDOM NUMBER
           PATTERNS.

           TWENTY FOUR CARDS OF EACH PATTERN ARE PUNCHED. A CHECK SUM
           OF EACH CARD IS PUNCHED IN 9 RIGHT. THE FOLLOWING PATTERNS
           WILL GIVE A RELIABILITY TEST TO ALL COMPONENTS OF THE PUNCH,
           ESPECIALLY THE ARC SUPPRESSOR CIRCUITS.

   0345 -  PATTERN FOUR  -- IS A 24 CARD RANDOM NUMBERS PATTERN WITH 9
                            RIGHT OF EACH CARD CONTAINING THE CHECK SUM
                            FOR THAT CARD.

                            THE OFF ROWS, EXCEPT 9 RIGHT, ARE DECREASED
                            IN MAGNITUDE SO THAT EACH WORD, LEFT AND
                            RIGHT, HAS ONE PUNCH, TWO PUNCHES, OR NO PUNCHES.

                            THE EVEN ROWS ARE INCREASED IN MAGNITUDE
                            AND ALL WORDS, LEFT AND RIGHT, ARE BUILT UP
                            UNTIL THE WORDS ARE EITHER ALMOST FULL OR
                            COMPLETELY FULL.

                            THIS PATTERN FIVES A SEQUENCE OF HEAVY EVEN
                            ROWS, AND LIGHT ODD ROWS, WHILE REMAINING
                            COMPLETELY RANDOM.

   0345 - PATTERN FIVE  --  IS A 24 CARD RANDOM NUMBERS PATTERN, THE
                            CHECK SUM OF EACH CARD IS PUNCHED IN 9 RIGHT.

                            PATTERN FIVE IS THE ALTERATE OF PATTERN FOUR.
                            IN THIS PATTERN, THE ODD ROWS ARE HEAVY AND
                            THE EVEN ROWS LIGHT.

   0462 - PATTERN SIX   --  IS A 24 RANDOM NUMBERS PATTERN. NINE

                                                                     9R01A
                                                                     11/1/58
                                                                     PAGE 1.004

                            RIGHT CONTAINS THE CHECK SUM.

                            THIS IS THE FIRST OF FOUR SIMILAR PATTERNS.

                            THESE FOUR PATTERNS ARE IDENTICAL TO THE BIAS
                            TEST CARDS.

                            PATTERN SIX HAS 3 LIGHT ROWS, 3 HEAVY ROWS,
                            AND SIX ZERO ROWS. ALL EVEN ROWS ARE ZERO.
                            ROWS 9,5, AND 1 ARE LIGHT, AND RANDOM, ROWS
                            7,3, AND 11 ARE HEAVY AND RANDOM.

   0462 - PATTERN SEVEN --  IS A 24 CARD RANDOM NUMBERS TEST, NINE RIGHT
                            CONTAINING THE CHECK SUM OF EACH CARD. THIS
                            TEST IS IDENTICAL TO PATTERN SIX EXCEPT THE
                            LIGHT AND HEAVY ROWS ARE SWITCHED. THE EVEN
                            ROWS ARE STILL ZERO.

                            THE PATTERN THEN IS - 9,5, AND 1 HEAVY- 7,3,
                            AND 11 LIGHT AND ALL EVEN ROWS ZERO.

   0462 - PATTERN EIGHT --  IS A 24 CARD RANDOM NUMBERS TEST, NINE
                            RIGHT CONTANING THE CHECK SUM OF EACH CARD.
                            NOW WE ZERO THE ODD ROWS, EXCEPT 9 RIGHT.

                            MAKE 6,2, AND 12 HEAVY AND 8,4, AND 0 LIGHT.

   0462 - PATTERN NINE  --  IS A 24 CARD RANDOM NUMBERS TEST, NINE RIGHT
                            CONTAINING THE CHECK SUM OF EACH CARD.

                            THE ODD ROWS ARE ZERO, EXCEPT 9 RIGHT.

                            ROWS 8,4, AND ZERO ARE HEAVY, ROWS 6,2, AND
                            12 ARE LIGHT.

          THESE LAST FOUR PATTERNS TEST EACH WORD AND EACH ROW, EXCEPT
          9R WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE CHECK SUM.

            AND 35.

        D.  IF NO TAG KEYS WERE PUT DOWN AT FIRST STOP A FURTHER HALT WILL
            OCCUR AT 5540 TO INDICATE THIS.

    NOTE -- IF A PUNCH IS SELECTED ON CHANNELS A, C AND E, IT WOULD PROBABLY
            BE DESIDERABLE TO SELECT A CARD READER, ONLY ON CHANNEL A, AND
            READ THE PUNCHED CARDS FROM ALL THREE PUNCHES ON CHANNEL A,
            HOWEVER, THIS NEED NOT BE DONE. ALL THREE CARD READERS MAY ALSO
            BE SELECTED.

I.  COMMENTS
        CAUTION --
        UNLESS YOU ARE REASONABLY SURE THAT THE CBS ARE WELL ADJUSTED,
        MAY WE SUGGEST THAT THE CB COVER BE OPENED WHEN RUNNING THIS TEST.
        IF ARCING BECOMES TOO VIOLENT, THE TEST MAY HAVE TO BE STOPPED TO
        AVOID BURNING OF CONTACTS. IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ADJUST CBS BEFORE
        RUNNING PROGRAM, AND/OR CHECK THE ARC SUPPRESSOR CIRCUITS.

                                                                     9R01A
                                                                     11/1/58
                                                                     PAGE 1.008


    THE PUNCH WILL NOT HAVE TO EXCEED SPECS. IN ORDER TO RUN
    THIS PROGRAM.

1.  9R01 DEPENDS UPON THE RELIABILITY OF STORAGE, CARD READER, AND
    MAIN FRAME.

2.  THE MAIN PROGRAM, THE 300 CARD 9 PATTERN TEST, HAS A READING
    RESTART. SO ANY TIME YOU ARE READING THESE CARDS AND HAVE TO
    RELOAD CARDS AND START OVER, IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO RESET AND
    PUSH START.

3.  WORD GENERATED IN PRINT OUT REFERS TO THE WORD WHICH WAS GENERATED
    FOR PUNCHING. WORD READ REFERS TO THE WORD THAT WAS PUNCHED.
    IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A READER ERROR. IF YOU SUSPECT THIS, COMPARE
    THE CARD AGAINST THE WORD GENERATED IN THE PRINTOUT TO DETERMINE
    WHICH ERROR OCCURRED.

4.  THE RECNO IN PRINT OUT REFERS TO THE CARD NUMBER. THE WDNO REFERS
    TO THE WORD ON THE CARD. WDNO 1 REFERS TO 9L, WDNO 2 REFERS TO
    9R AND ETC.

    THE PRINT FORMAT WILL INDICATE THE CORRECT RECORD NUMBER AND WORD
    NUMBER EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A CHECK SUM ERROR. IN THIS CASE THE
    WORD NUMBER WILL BE 00000.

5.  THIS TEST HAS PROVEN MOST RIGOUROUS FOR THE PUNCH. IT IS SUGGESTED
    THAT THE PANEL COVERING THE CBS BE OPENED WHILE RUNNNING.

NOTE -- FOR THIS TEST TO OPERATE CORRECTLY, THE PUNCH WILL NOT NEED TO
        EXCEED SPECIFICATIONS.

6.  THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO RUN RANDOM NUMBER PATTERNS 4
    THROUGH 9 IN RANDOM LATCH UP.

    CONSTANT K1100 OR LOCATION 2043 CONTAINS OCTAL 1100. THIS CONSTANT
    SHOULD BE ADJUSTED AT EACH INSTALLATION TO CAUSE THE DESIRED LATCH UP.

    TO RUN WITH NO LATCH UP PLACE ZERO IN LOCATION 2043.

7.  THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN WRITTEN SO AS TO THOROUGHLY TEST THE CB S,
    PUNCH MAGNETS, THE WRITE THYRATRONS, THE PUNCH DIE, AND THE
    MECHANICAL OPERATION UNDER START-STOP OR LATCH-UP CONDITION.
    THE LAST 96 RANDOM CARDS ALSO ARE BUILT TO CAUSE ADDED VIBRATION.
