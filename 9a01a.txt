                 DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR SPECIAL REAL TIME CONTROLS

A.  UNIT TESTED

    1.  PURPOSE OF TEST -- TO CHECK THE 709 SPECIAL REAL TIME FEATURES TO BE
        USED WITH THE AZUSA SYSTEM.

B.  METHOD OF TEST

    1.  LOCATION 30-72. CHECK THAT THE 16 DRUM SELECTS ON PAGE 7.04 ARE
        WORKING PROPERLY.

        THESE LINES ARE BROUGHT UP BY THE CORRESPONDING DRUM SELECT
        INSTRUCTIONS AND DOWN BY A SPECIAL DISCONNECT INSTRUCTION. THESE
        LINES MAY BESCOPED BY PUTTING SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN AND SYNCING ON
        THE READ DRUM 1 LINE WHILE CHECKING THE OTHER IN ORDER. THE
        PANEL PINS FOR EACH OF THESE OUTPUTS MAY BE FOUND IN THE PROGRAM
        COMMENTS.

    2.  LOCATIONS 73-121.TEST THAT THE CPY AND LDA INSTRUCTIONS TURN ON THE
           I-O CHECK LIGHT AND END OPERATION.

        THIS CAN BE SEEN ON PAGE 5.03.01 SINCE THE TOP LEG OF CKT. 1146 D
        IS TIED TO PLUS 10V AND THE MIDDLE LEG OF 1146 G IS ALWAYS UP.
        UNDER THESE CONDITIONS CPY AND LDA WILL END OPERATION EVEN
        THROUGH THE REST OF THEIR CORRESPONDING CIRCUITRY IS BLOCKED.

    3.  LOCATION 122-137,CHECK THAT THE CRT TRIGGERS ON 5.01.08 ARE WORKING
        PROPERLY.

        THESE TWO TRIGGERS MAY BE TESTED BY SCOPING WITH SWITCH 2 DOWN.
        IF SWT 2 IS UP THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE ONE PASS AND CONTINUE TO THE
        NEXT SECTION. THE TRIGGERS ARE TURNED ON BY THE CORRESPONDING CRT
        SELECTS AND OFF BY RESET DRUM INTERLOCK WHICH IS CONDITIONED BY
        THE DIRECT DATA DISCOUNT INSTRUCTION. THE PROGRAM ALSO CHECKS
        THAT THESE TRIGGERS MAY BE ON AT THE SAME TIME. THE PANEL PINS
        FOR SCOPING MAY BE FOUND IN THE PROGRAM COMMENTS.

    4.  LOCATIONS 140-155.TEST THAT IF EITHER OR BOTH CRT TRIGGER ARE
        SELECTED A DRUM READ OR WRITE SELECT MAY BE GIVEN WITHOUT HANGUP.

        THIS IS TRUE SINCE THE DRUM READ OR WRITE SELECTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT
        ON THE CRT SELECTS TO END OPERATION. PAGE 5.03.01. HOWEVER THE
        REVERSE DOES NOT HOLD.


                                                                   9A01A
                                                                   12-24-58
                                                                   PAGE 2



    5.  LOCATION 156-217.WITH SWITCH 3 DOWN CHECK THAT WHEN MORE THAN ONE
        DRUM SELECT IS GIVEN WITHOUT A DISCONNECT THE MACHINE WILL HANGUP.

        AS CAN BE SEEN ON PAGE 5.02 THE SECOND DRUM SELECT WILL NOT TURN ON THE
        READ-WRITE TRIGGER AND END OPERATION. WHEN THE MACHINE FAILS TO
        END OPERATION IT IS HUNG UP ALTHOUGH THE INSTRUCTION COUNTER HAS
        BEEN STEPED TO THE NEXT ADDRESS. THE MACHINE MUST THEN BE RESET AND
        WHEN THE START BUTTON IS DEPRESSED IT WILL CONTINUE IN THE PROGRAM
        SINCE A TRANSFER HAS PERVIOUSLY BEEN STORED IN 00000.
        WHEN SWITCH 3 IS UP THE PROGRAM WILL BYPASS THIS SECTION.

    6.  LOCATION 220-233.WITH SWITCH 3 DOWN CHECK THAT THE NOP INSTRUCTION
        DOES NOT GIVE A DIRECT DATA DISCONNECT.

        IT SHOULD BE BLOCKED FROM DOING SO BY CKT. 1039G ON PAGE 5.01.08.
        RESET AND PRESS START ON HANGUP-SEE =5 ABOVE.
        WHEN SWITCH 3 IS UP THE PROGRAM WILL BYPASS THIS SECTION.

    7.  LOCATION 234-272.WITH SWITCH 3 DOWN CHECK THAT IF EITHER DRUM 
        READ OR WRITE SELECT TRIGGERS ARE ON, EITHER CRT INSTRUCTION WILL
        HANGUP THE MACHINE.

        THIS IS CAUSED BY THE CRT WRITE SELECT INSTRUCTION FAILING TO END
        OPERATION BECAUSE CKT. 1039 D ON PAGE 5.01.08 CANNOT BE CONDITIONED.
        RESET + PRESS START ON HANGUP SEE =5 ABOVE.
        WHEN SWITCH 3 IS UP THE PROGRAM WILL BYPASS THIS SECTION.

    8.  LOCATION 273-304.TEST THAT A CHANNEL CAN BE SELECTED AND PUT INTO
        OPERATION AFTER A DRUM HAS BEEN SELECTED.

        THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE LINE-NOT DRUM READ OR WRITE SELECT-IS NOT
        BROUGHT INTO THE CKTS. 1036R + 1036S ON 5.01.07.
        A ONE WORD RECORD IS WRITTEN ON TAPE 1-CHANNEL A WHEN DRUM 1
        HAS BEEN WRITE SELECTED.
        THE SAME WORD IS ALSO WRITTEN WITH A READ DRUM SELECT LINE UP.


                                                                   9A01A
                                                                   12-24-58
                                                                   PAGE 3



    9.  LOCATION 305-320.WITH SWITCH 4 DOWN CHECK THAT A DRUM MAY BE
        SELECTED WITH A CHANNEL IN USE.

        WITH THIS SWITCH DOWN THERE IS A HTR AT LOCATION 307. AT TIS
        POINT TAPE UNIT 1 CHANNEL A  MUST BE TAKEN OUT OF READY STATUS
        IN ORDER TO KEEP CHANNEL A SELECTED .
        WHEN THE START BUTTON IS DEPRESSED THE PROGRAM WILL LOOP BETWEEN THE
        DRUM 1 READ AND WRITE SELECTS AND CAN BE SEEN BY SCOPING THE INDICATED
        POINTS. WITH SWITCH 4 BACK UP THERE IS A HTR AT LOCATION 320 TO ALLOW
        TAPE UNIT 1-CHANNEL A TO BE PUT BACK INTO READY STATUS.
        IF SWITCH 4 IS NEVER DEPRESSED THE PROGRAM WILL BYPASS THIS SECTION.
        
    10. LOCATIONS 321-341.WITH SWITCH 5 DOWN CHECK INTERRUPT AND TRAP TO
        00004.

        WHEN DOWN THERE IS A HTR AT LOCATION 323 WHICH ALLOWS A
        JUMPER TO BE INSTALLED FROM MF4-AD TO MF4-37J. THIS ALLOWS THE UNIT
        ADDRESS 1 LINE ON PAGE 5.01.02 TO CONDITION INTERRUPT DEMAND ON
        2.07.75.
        CHECKING INTERRUPT WITH A DRUM SELECTED, WE SHOULD NOT BE
        ABLE TO TRAP. IF WE DO SO THE MACHINE WILL HALT AT 00004.
        CHECKING INTERRUPT WHEN A DRUM IS NOT SELECTED SHOULD TRAP
        TO 00004 AND TRANSFER BACK TO THE PROGRAM. IF WE FAIL TO TRAP THE
        MACHINE WILL HALT AT LOCATION 334. AS LONG AS SWT. 5 IS DOWN WE WILL
        LOOP IN THIS AREA AND THE INTERRUP LINE MY BE SCOPED AT PANEL PIN
        MF4--R37-6.
        WHEN SWT 5 IS BACK UP THE MACHINE WILL HALT AT 341 AND THE JUMPER
        MUST BE REMOVED.

    11. LOCATIONS 342-351.IF SWITCH 6 IS DOWN THE PROGRAM WILL REPEAT. WHEN
        IT IS UP THE NEXT PROGRAM WILL BE READ IN FROM THE CARD READER.
