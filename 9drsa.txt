                   DROP READY AND TEST READY STATUS
                   SPECIAL FEATURE TEST - E. C. 298680

A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   The purpose of this program is to test two new instructions.
   
   1. Drop ready status -- DRS -- operation code 0775.

   2. Test Ready Status -- TRS -- Operation Code -0775. This instruction
      should skip one instruction if the unit is ready, and will take the next
      instruction if drive is not ready.

      Both these instruction have to do only with ready in tape drives.

B. METHOD OF TEST

   1. The program uses 9IOM to determine which drives are to be tested. Any
      drives to be tested must be in ready status at start of program.

   2. Program tests transfer ready - TRS - with drives in ready status.

   3. Ready status is then dropped on all drives by the use of drop ready
      instruction - DRS.

   4. Test ready status - TRS - is tested with drives out of ready.

   5. A normal stop will occur at 00130. At this time the operator must reset 
      and press start button on all drives being tested, and then depress start
      button on console.

   6. All tapes selected will be written, to prove that the trigger in the 
      drive was reset by pushing the tape drive start button.

   7. Ready status is dropped during rewind. A normal stop will occur at 00236.
      At this stop the operator must reset and press start on all drives 
      selected, and then press start on console.

C. AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

   1. Any number of tape drives on any channels,
   
      MF, CF, CR, PR, DS.

   2. Storage Locations 00030-00632-9DRS
                        05500-06476-9IOM

                                                                              1

D. PROGRAM CONTROL

   1. 9IOM-Selection of tape units on any channels will be with the keys.
      See Enclosed Selection Diagram.

   2. Sense Switch Control

      SSW 1 UP - Do not repeat section
      SSW 1 DN - Repeat section of test-on error
      SSW 2 UP - Test switch 3
      SSW 2 DN - Test Switch 1 - Bypass error
      SSW 3 UP - Print error
      SSW 3 DN - Halt on error
      SSW 4 - Not used
      SSW 5 - Up test switch 6
      SSW 5 DN - Loop in initail units, without halt in 9IOM
      SSW 6 UP - Call in next program
      SSW 6 ON - Repeat test, going back to 9IOM

E. NORMAL STOPS

   1. 00130 - Push start on all tape drives being tested, then press start on
	      console.
   2. 00236 - Push start on all tape drives being tested, then press start on
	      console.
   3. 05517 - 9IOM, to enter selection for channels A + B.
   4. 05533 - 9IOM, to enter selection for channels C + D.
   5. 05540 - 9IOM, to enter selection fro channel E + F.

F. ERROR STOPS

   1. 00345 - Halt on error with swith =3 down. Press start on console to 
              continue test.
   2. 05525 - 9IOM, no tag keys thrown down on halt at 05517. Throw down
              tag keys and press start.

G. PRINT ROUTINE

   1. The standatd diagnostic print routine - 9DEPR - is not used. The routine
      which is used gives one line of print per error.

   SAMPLE ERROR PRINT

      ERROR ADDR 00053 - TRSA 1 - FAILED

      The error address will indicate the error exit in the program, and TRSA 1
      will indicate that the transfer ready status instruction failed on
      channel A tape unit 1.
   
      The - DRS - instruction will print in the same manner, on error.

                                                                              2

H. COMMENTS

   1. The DRS instruction is performed, and TRS is tested immediately
      afterwards, therefore, it is impossible for the program to tell which
      instruction failed, because TRS is used to see that DRS did drop ready
      in the drive.
   
      A DRS printout will occur on error, but it will be necessary to note
      whether the particular tape drive, involved, is in ready status, to 
      determine which instruction failed - DRS or TRS. (Loc. 00117)

   2. 9IOM has been altered, to take care of the two new instructions.

   3. DRS will be given while the tape is writing to make sure DRS will not
      operate until the drive has finished writing.

   4. DRS will be given while the tape is rewinding to make sure DRS will not
      allow the drive to come back to ready after rewind.

   5. Tape drive 1 on channel A will be tested last.
