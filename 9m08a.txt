              FLOATING POINT ADD AND SUBTRACT DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM
            SIMULATING RESULTS WITH NON FLOATING POINT INSTRUCTIONS 

A. \U UNIT TESTED\u

    1.  \UPURPOSE OF TEST\u

        TO AID THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER IN LOCATING MACHINE TROUBLES DUE TO
        FAILURE IN THE EXECUTION OF FLOATING POINT ADD AND SUBTRACT
        INSTRUCTIONS.

        TO BE USED TOGETHER WITH 9M05 IN GIVING A MORE COMPLETE COVERAGE OF
        FLOATING POINT ADD AND SUBTRACT INSTRUCTIONS.


    2.  \UMETHOD OF TEST\u

        A.  TO DETERMINE BY MEANS OF NONFLOATING POINT INSTRUCTIONS WHAT
        THE CORRECT END RESULT OF A PARTICULAR PROBLEM SHOULD BE IF
        EXECUTED IN FLOATING POINT.
        
        THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARED AGAINST THE END RESULTS OF THE SAME
        PROBLEM WORKED BY USE OF THE FLOATING POINT INSTRUCTION
        UNDER TEST.

        IF THE TWO DO NOT COMPARE AS EQUAL, THE SAME PROBLEMA IS AGAIN
        WORKED BY MEANS OF NONFLOATING POINT INSTRUCTION. WE THUS
        DETERMINE, AND PRINT OUT, CORRECT MACHINE CONDITIONS WHICH
        SHOULD BE PRESENT AT THE END OF EACH MACHINE CYCLE DURING THE
        EXECUTION OF THE PROBLEM IN FLOATING POINT.

        AFTER PRINT OUT, A HALT WILL OCCUR. AT THIS TIME, \UTHE MACHINE\u
        \UCYCLE KEY MAY BE USED TO OBSERVE THE VALUES WHICH APPEAR WITH\u
        \UTHE CRRECT CYCLIC MACHINE VALUES PREVIOUSLY PRINTED.\u

        IF AT ANY POINT THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO, THE
        ERROR MAY BE ANALYZED MORE READILY THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE FROM
        HAVING SEEN ONLY THE FINAL RESULT WHICH WAS DEVELOPED OVER
        SEVERAL MACHINE CYCLES.

F. \U PRINTOUT\u

    THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT USE 9DEPR, BUT HAS ITS OWN PRINT ROUTINE.

    PRINTOUTS OCCUR ON ERROR. A PRINTOUT MAY BE FORCED AT ANY TIME BY
    SETTING SSW 6 DOWN. AN ACTUAL PRINTOUT FOR EACH TYPE OF TEST
    FOLLOWS THE COMMENT SECTION. THE NUMBER APPEARING IN THE CYCLE
    COLUMN IS IN DECIMAL, BUT ALL OTHER VALUES ARE IN OCTAL.

    THE TC COLUMN MAY APPEAR BLANK DURING SOME CYCLES, BUT ACTUALLY
    INDICATES THAT THE TC VALUE HAS NOT CHANGED FROM THE LAST PRINTED
    VALUE.

                    CYCLE BUT SHOULD BE TURNED OFF BEFORE THE END OF THE CYCLE

    ALL OTHER VALUES REFLECT MACHINE CONDITIONS AT THE END OF THE CYCLE
    SPECIFIED.

    BITS IN ACCUMULATOR Q AND P WILL BE SHOWN AS Q AND/OR P PRECEEDING ACC
    VALUE.

    THE ERROR RESULT WHICH APPEARS AT THE END OF THE PRINTOUT REFLECTS THE
    MACHINE CONDITION AT THE END OF THE PROBLEM WORKED BY FLOATING POINT
    INSTRUCTIONS.

    THE SPILL CODE NUMBER REFERS TO BITS 15, 16, AND 17 OF LOCATION ZERO ON
    TRAP. THESE BITS ARE USED TO INDICATE THE CAUSE AND TYPE OF OVERFLOW
    OR UNDERFLOW. SEE ELECTRONIC OPERATION MANUAL OR PROGRAMMERS REFERENCE
    MANUAL.

G. \U MACHINE CYCLE KEY OPERATION\u

    AFTER PRINTOUT, YOU MAY OBSERVE THE CYCLIC MACHINE VALUES WHILE EXECUTING
    THE PROBLEM UNDER TEST.

    TO DO THIS PUT MACHINE IN MANUAL, PRESS START, AND DEPRESS THE MACHINE CYCLE
    KEY ONE TO GET OUT OF THE HPR ER TIME WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES THE
    FLOATING POINT TEST INSTRUCTION.

    FOR EACH ADDITIONAL DEPRESSION THE MACHINE SHOULD DISPLAY VALUES AS
    INDICATED BY THE PRINTOUT AND COMPARISON OF MACHINE VERSUS PRINTED VALUES
    MAY BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

    IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS FROM PRIOR TROUBLESHOOTING EXPERIENCE THAT IN MOST
    CASES THE FIRST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORRECT PRINTED VALUES AND DISPLAYED
    MACHINE VALUES SHOULD BE \UTHE POINT TO DIG IN\u TO THE PROBLEM OF DETERMINING
    WHICH MACHINE LOGIC FAILED. IN MOST CASES, CORRELATION OF MACHINE
    FUNCTIONS, AS OBSERVED BY KEYING THROUGH THE INSTRUCTION AND FOLLOWING
    ELECTRONICS OPERATIONS VOLUME 1, WILL PROVIDE A LOGICAL CLUE TO FAILING
    MACHINE AREAS.

    IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IF AN INTERMITTENT TROBLE EXISTS, IT MAY BE

                                                            9M08A
                                                            12/12/58
                                                            Page 1.03.0
    POSSIBILE THAT NO ERROR CONDITION WILL BE DETECTED DURING COMPARISON OF
    MACHINE VALUES TO PRINTED VALUES.

H. \U PROGRAM FEATURES-\u

    1.  MANUAL DATA ENTRY--

            ANY SET OF DATA SO DESIRED MAY BE ENTERED MANUALLY AND TESTED BY
            THE USE OF SENSE SWITCH THREE. WHEN SWITCH 3 IS PUT DOWN, IF SWITCH
            FOUR IS UP, A HALT WILL OCCUR AT WHICH TIME THE MACHINE SHOULD BE
            PUT IN MANUAL AND THE ACC DATA ENTERED INTO THE KEYS.
            RETURNING THE MACHINE TO AUTOMATIC AND STARTING WILL CAUSE A
            SECOND HALT WHERE THE SR DATA CAN BE ENTERED IN THE
            SAME MANNER. IF IT IS DESIRED TO KEEP THE ENTERED DATA CONSTANT
            UNTIL AN ERROR OCCURS, SWITCH FOUR MAY BE PUT DOWN AT THIS POINT.

    2.  SCOPE LOOP--

            USE MAY BE MADE OF SENSE SWITCH FIVE TO CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO ENTER
            A TIGHT LOOP WHICH MAY BE USED FOR SCOPING PURPOSES. THE LOOP
            WILL BE ENTERED ONLY AFTER A PRINTOUT AND AFTER MACHINE CYCLE KEY
            USE HAS BEEN MADE IF SWITCH FIVE IS DOWN AND WILL REPETITIVELY
            EXECUTE THE SAME TEST PROBLEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OUT. EXIT FROM
            THE LOOP TO THE MAIN PROGRAM MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY RAISING
            SWITCH FIVE.

    3.    FORCED PRINTOUT--

            IF IT IS DESIRED TO SEE THE CYCLIC RESULT OF ANY PARTICULAR
            PROBLEM UNDER TEST WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR AN ERROR CONDITION
            TO CAUSE ENTRY TO THE PRINT ROUTINE, SWITCH 6 MAY BE PUT DOWN
            AND PRINTOUT WILL RESULT. A HALT WILL OCCUR AT ONE OF THE LISTED
            ERROR STOPS. IF IT IS NOT DESIRED TO COMPARE CYCLIC MACHINE VALUES
            AT THIS TIME PUSH THE START KEY TWICE TO CONTINUE.

    4.  POST RESTART-

            NO POST RESTART IS PROVIDED SINCE TRAP CONDITIONS ARE STORED AT ZERO.
            THE NORMAL RETURN FOR NEW DATA IS TO LOCATION 40. A MANUAL TRA TO 40
            IS THE CORRECT THING TO DO IF YOU GET HUNG UP IN ANY WAY AND WANT
            TO START OVER AGAIN.

    5.  NUMBER OF PASSES INTERROGATION--

            IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AT ANY GIVEN TIME THE NUMBER OF PASSES
            THE PROGRAM HAD MADE BY DISPLAYING STORAGE LOCATION 2363. THIS WILL
            BE THE NUMBER OF TIMES NEW TEST DATA HAS BEEN SELECTED AND USED IN
            THE TEST. REPETITIVE PASSES USING THE SAME DATA ARE NOT COUNTED.

I. \U COMMENTS--\u

        TEST DATA USED IS DERIVED FROM A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR WHICH STORES
        NUMBER AT ADDRESSES 2720 TO 7777. AFTER THESE HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED A NEW
        SET OF RANDOM NUMBERS ARE GENERATED SO THAT REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THE
        PROGRAM RUNS IT CONTINUES TO USE NEW TEST DATA. BY THIS METHOD EVERY

                                                            9M08A
                                                            12/12/58
                                                            Page 1.04.0
        POSSIBLE DATA CONFIGURATION IS TESTED COVERING THE WIDEST POSSIBLE RANGE
        OF PROBLEM CONDITIONS.

        THE NUMBER OF PASSES THROUGH THE PROGRAM IS NOT LIMITED, BUT WILL
        CONTINUE TO RUN AS LONG AS DESIRED AT THE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5800
        PASSES PER MINUTE. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAM BE ALLOWED TO RUN
        SEVERAL MINUTES FOR MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS IN LOCATING A MACHINE
        MALFUNCTION.

        IT IS INTENDED THAT ALL NONFLOATING POINT INSTRUCTIONS BE THOROUGHLY
        TESTED BY USE OF OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS AND THAT IT BE REASONABLE SURE
        THAT THE AREA OF MALFUNCTION LIES WITHIN FLOATING POINT CONTROL LINES OR
        LOGIC BEFORE RESORTING TO THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM. REASON FOR THIS
        STATEMENT LIES IN THE FACT THAT MANY NONFLOATING POINT INSTRUCTIONS ARE
        USED TO DIRECTLY DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF THE FLOATING POINT INSTRUCTION
        UNDER TEST. IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THEN THAT ITS INDISCRIMINATE USE MIGHT
        VERY WELL SERVE TO CONFUSE RATHER THAN AID THE USERS.

      \U  BIASING-\u
        	IF IT IS DESIRED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM UNDER BIAS CONDITIONS, IT
        	SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT ITS CORRECT OPERATION DEPENDS UPON THE
        	PROPER EXECUTION OF NUMEROUS FIXED POINT INSTRUCTIONS. THEREFORE
        	BIAS LIMITS SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED TO THE POINT OF CAUSING FIXED
        	POINT FAILURES, BUT KEPT SAFELY WITHIN THESE LIMITS.

       \U TRAP PROBLEMS-\u

        	ON SEVERAL TIMED RUNS, USING PRESENT RANDOM NUMBER DATA GENERATOR,
        	IT WAS FOUND THAT A TRAPPING CONDITION OCCURED ONCE IN APPROXIMATELY
        	EVERY 75 PROBLEMS WORKED.

        	\UTRAPPING PROBLEMS MAY BE FOUND\u ON EITHER INSTRUCTION BY MANUALLY
        	LOWERING AND RAISING SSW 4 UNTIL SL 4 COMES ON. WHEN SL 4 COMES ON,
        	LEAVE SSW 4 DN AND USE AS DESIRED-FOR CONTINUOUS RUN ON TRAP, FOR
        	SCOPING ON TRAP, OF FOR FORCED PRINT OUT FOR EXAMINATION AND ETC.

        	BE SURE THAT SL 4 DOES NOT GO OFF WHEN LOWERING AND RAISING SSW 4.
        	IF SL 4 GOES OFF, YOU RAISED SS4 ENOUGH TO LOSE TRAP PROBLEM AND
        	BRING IN ANOTHER PROBLEM. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, LOOK FOR ANOTHER AND
        	BE MORE CAREFUL.

       \U RUNNING AND OPERATION\u

        	1.  LOAD PROGRAM WITH CORRECT SSW SETTING
        	2.  EXCEPTIONS- \UNORMAL RUNNING\u WILL BE WITH SSW 6 UP. REMEMBER THAT
        	    PLACING SSW 6 DN GIVES A FORCE PRINT OUT WITHOUT ERROR. WITH SSW 6
        	    UP PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO RUN UNTIL AN ERROR OCCURS.

        	    \UNEXT PROGRAM\u - MAY BE CALLED IN BY RESETTING OR CLEARING AND
        	    PUSHING LOAD CARDS.

        	    \UTO START ANEW\u-MANUALLY TRA TO 40, SET IN AUTOMATIC, AND PUSH
                    START.

        	3.  \UON ERROR\u - YOU WILL PRINT. AFTER PRINT, PROGRAM STOPS. THEN --


                                                            9M08A
                                                            12/12/58

        		   IS IN FLOATING POINT.
        		   CONTINUE THIS, MOVING ON THROUGH TO THE LAST CYCLE.

\USPECIAL NOTE:\u

        If trouble should be encountered while performing UFA and UFS instructions,
        be sure that EC 245677 has been installed.  This change corrects the logical
        error found by this program.

        The program will perform correctly for FAD and FSB without this change,
        but will not run free of errors on UFA and UFS dur to certain problems
        \Ubringing up step five output line\u on systems 2. 08. 34 whith tries to cause
        an MQ and ACC left shit.

        If EC 245677 is not installed, tube MF1 J28 07 (CF) may be pulled to keep
        step five output line down while running UFA and UFS.  By doing this the
        program will run correctly and any errors obtained on UFA and UFS now
        will be due to soe other machine bugs.  They may be troubleshot with
        tube out since the other half of tube is for operation panel keys to storage
        register circuits.
