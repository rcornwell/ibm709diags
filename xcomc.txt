PURPOSE OF CHANGE

     1.   To allow this program to be run on the 7094

     2.   This program now contains a routine to printout unexpected traps
          showing the location +1 of where the trap occurred.

     3.   There are 3 new optional routines which check BTTX and ETTX
          (709 instructions).  See Section C - 4.

     4.   To update printouts to conform with present level of program i.e. XCOMB
          to be XCOMC

     5.   Sense Switch 5 can now be used to provide a clean program halt. The
          program will now run properly if it is desired not to change mades.

     7090-  EC 248939

            For the BTTx and Ettx test routines, the optional change called
            out in the 7090.  Service Aid #81 has to be installed to insure  
            proper operation of those test routines.

E.   ERROR STOPS (All errors in program are indicated by halts)

     1. Basic routines -     consult comment associated with HTR or HPR.

     2. 9M05B          -     With a stop at location 06520 or 06546 true
                             location where error occurred is displayed in
                             XRC.  Refer to location in listing shown in XRC
                             to indicate type of error with pertinent procedure
                             instructions.

F.  PRINTOUTS

     1. Program identification and size of nullified storage testing is printed
        out immediately after a nullify storage selection is made if sense switch
        3 is up.

     2. The printer will print two lines if the RESET BUTTON routines are
        executed successfully.

     3. Illegal traps from 9M05 showing the location plus one from where the
        trap occurred are printed out.

     4. With sense switches 3 and 5 up and sense switch 6 down, the program
        is repeating with the same selected nullify storage and the printer
        will indicate every 100 passes made.

     5. Whenever sense switch 5 is depressed, (an indication that the alternate
        nullify storage size is to be tested), the total number of passes completed
        with the size of nullify storage tested is printed out if sense switch 3 is up.
 
     6. With sense switch 3 and 6 up, the total number of passes completed by
        the program is printed out prior to loading the next program.


G. COMMENTS

     1. On a machine with only a 16K nullified storage, sense switch 5 can be
        used to provide a clean halt.

     2. Although the XCOM basic routine program is contained within locations 
        10000 - 13260 the program maintains an exit routine for a SELECT,
        SENSE, CPY, CAD or LDA trap in lcoations 40001-40006.  Locations
        40007 - 40017 are used when storage is nullified from 16K and locations
        20007 - 20017 are used when storage is nullified from 8K.

     3. Locations 40020 - 40225 contain a routine inserted to determine locations
        trapped from in 9M05


XCOMC
3/15/63
Page 8

G.   4. If the sign key is up and sense switch 3 is down the reset and load button
        test are bypassed

     5. A one word record is written on tape to avoid run-a-way.

     6. 9M05 uses a modified version of 9DEPR which can be found on
        Page 66 of the listing.

     7. Sense switch 5 has been made ineffective when executing 9M05 and there-
        fore the FDH stop at Location 00621 is bypassed.

     8. All unoccupied storage locations are filled with STR when executing XCOM
        and TSX 06174 when executing 9M05

     9. 9M05 monitor location 06253 has been alterd to transfer to location
        06273.  Location 06273 - 06347 provide routines to check the correct
        status of the campatibility triggers after execution of a 9M05 test, the
        2 page instruction sequence can be found just before the modified version
        of DEPR of the listing.

    10. A manual transfer to any routine in either section of XCOM should be
        to the initial instruction of the routine. To avoid a false monitor error
        stop, leave the keys down, since both monitors check the keys for a 
        manual transfer.

    11. When encoutering an error stop, refer to the appropriate listing for
        comments and instructions to determine the type of error.
 
    12. BTTx with trigger ON, if selected to be tested, is only tested on
        first pass.  This prevents wearing out the tape in one spot due to re-
        winds.  If Key 34 was not down on the first pass, this routine will
        never be performed.
