F.  PRINTOUTS

    1.  PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION IS PRINTED OUT BEFORE STARTING THE TEST IF
	SWITCH 3 IS UP.

    2. 	PROGRAM PRINTS *100 PROGRAM PASSES COMPLETE 9M02* IF SWITCH 3 IS
	UP AND SWITCH 6 IS DOWN.

    3.  IF FAST MPY TAKES MORE THAN 2 CYCLES, THERE IS A PRINTOUT INDICATING
	THIS ERROR IF SENSE SWITCH 3 IS UP.

    4.  REFER TO PAGE 1.004 FOR EXAMPLES OF PRINTOUTS.

    5.  CONSULT THE WRITE-UP AND LISTING FOR 9DEPR FOR A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF
 	THE DIAGNOSTIC PRINT SUBROUTINE

G.  COMMENTS

    1.  9M02 TESTS INDICATOR INSTRUCTIONS WITH PRIMARY OP 0,4 FOR FALSE
	TRAPPING. LOCATIONS 00001-00010 CONTAIN A SUBROUTINE TO TRANSFER TO
	THE MAIN PROGRAM IN CASE OF A FALSE TRAP.

    2.  9M02 CHECKS THE RESTORING OF THE ACCUMULATOR BY CERTAIN INDICATOR
	INSTRUCTIONS. THIS SUBROUTINE IS IN LOCATIONS 05273-05320.IF
	THERE IS AN ERROR,THE MQ WILL CONTAIN THE LOCATION OF THE
	INSTRUCTION BEING TESTED AND THE ACCUMULATOR CONTAINS THE
	ERROR INFORMATION.

    3.  BECAUSE OF LOCATION LIMITATION IN 9M01, ADDITIONAL TESTS OF INSTRUCTIONS
	CHECKED IN 9M01 FOLLOW THE INDICATOR INSTRUCTION TESTS.

    4.  WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 DEPRESSED THE CONSOLE DISPLAY BUTTONS AND FAST
	MULTIPLY TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON THE INITIAL PASS. ON SUCCEEDING
	PASSES, THE FAST MULTIPLY TEST IS BYPASSED.

    5.  CARD 163 IS THE FAST MPY TEST CARD AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE PLACED AFTER
	THE TRANSFER CARD.

    6.  THE DECREMENT PORTION OF LOCATION 07570 CONTAINS THE 2-S COMPLEMENT OF
	THE LAST TEST ADDRESS PERFORMED CORRECTLY.

    7.  ALTHOUGH INDEXING HAS NOT BEEN CHECKED, IT IS USED SPARING FOR THE
	RIPPLE TESTS.

    8.  ALSO WITH AND ERROR IN THE CONVERT ROUTINES, INITIALLY INVESTIGATE
	THE CORRECT OPERATION OF XRA.
