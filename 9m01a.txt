         MAIN FRAME DIAGNOSTIC AND RELIABILITY TEST
A. UNIT TESTED - 709 CPU
   1. Purpose of Test
      (a) Examine fixed-point and logical arithmetic, word transmission,
          shifting, control, and logical operations.
      (b) This program (9M01B) contains some routine modifications and
          additions to 9M01A.
   2. Method of Test
      (a) The program is divided in two parts under Sense Switch 5 Control.
      (b) This test employs a short version of 9DEPR which will interrogate
          sense switches and print a detailed account of error indications.
      (c) Refer to Sense Switch Control Section C-2 for an explanation of
	  Program Operation and Control.
B. MACHINE UNITS AND STORAGE AREA
   1. Units required
      MF, CF, DSU, CR, PR
   2. Storage locations
      00030-07767
C. PROGRAM CONTROL
   1. Deck
		000         9LDO1 Low End Loader
		001 - 184   Program Cards and Short Version 9DEPR
		185         Transfer Card TRA 00030

   2. Sense Switch Control
      Switch 1 UP		 Test Switch 4
      Switch 1 DOWN		 Repeat Routine
      Switch 2 UP		 Indicate Errors
      Switch 2 DOWN		 Bypass Errors
      Switch 3 UP		 Print errors if Switch 2 is UP
      Switch 3 DOWN		 Halt on error if Switch 2 is UP
      Switch 4 UP		 Proceed to next Routine
      Switch 4 DOWN		 Loop in Routine 50 times octal and then
				 proceed to next Routine
      Switch 5 UP		 Bypass long adder test and testing all
				 instructions requiring stops to determine
				 proper execution
      Switch 5 DOWN		 Perform long adder test and testing all
				 instructions requiring stops to determine
				 proper execution
      Switch 6 UP		 Call in next diagnostic
      Switch 6 DOWN		 Repeat test note program prints out
				 "100 Program Passes Complete 9M01"
				 every 100 passes if switch 3 is UP.
D. NORMAL STOPS
      06350 DVH Test
      06360 DVH Test
      06371 DVH Test
      06403 VDH Test
      06427 ENK Teat - Enter ones in keys
      06441 ENK Test - Enter zeros in keys

E. ERROR STOPS
      00035 Error in TSX inetruction
      00037 Error in TSX instruction
      07065 Error in Program with Switch 3 DOWN
        or
      07103 Display XRC for location of error-XRC has 2-s complement of
            error address

F. PRINTOUTS
    1. Program identification is printed out before starting the test if
       Switch 3 is UP.
    2. Program prints "100 Program Passes Complete 9M01" if Switch 3
       is UP and Switch 6 is DOWN,
    3. In an error printout, test LOC is Routine in Error, OPN is Instruction
       Being Tested and error ADR is Section of Routine in Error.
    4. Sample of the printout follows the write-ups.
    5. Consult the write-up for 9DEPR for a detailed account of the diagnostic
       print subroutine.

G. COMMENTS

    1. With Switch 5 depressed, the halt tests and the long adder tests are
       performed on the initial pass, On succeeding passes, the halt tests
       are bypassed.
    2. Prior to checking the contents of index registers after performing
       the STR instruction and Switch 3 is UP, any error encountered will alter
       the value 077707 octal initially placed in XRC.
    3. The decrement portion sf location 07701 contains the 2's complement of
       the last test address performed correctly.
    4. Although indexing has not been checked, it has been used sparingly
       because of space limitation in a 4K storage.
    5. The optional use of XRA is a feature of the convert instructions
       and is checked in this test. Since indexing has not been tested
       in 9M01, the C. E, should investigate the correct operation of
       index registers with any error in the CVR, CAQ or CRQ Routines
       where an instruction is tagged with XRA.
    6. It is possible for the program to appear to be operating error free
       although the machine is actually malfunctioning. To detect this case,
       Sense Switch 3 must be UP and Sense Swltch 6 DOWN. Under these
       conditions, the printer must print "100 Program Passes Complete 9M0l".
       Failure of the printout may indicate that E and I Time are coming up
       simultaneously in convert instructions.
    7. The Release of 9M01B makes 9MOlA cbsdete.
