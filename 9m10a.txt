     TRANSFER CONTROL.

  2. METHOD

     THE INSTRUCTIONS FRN AND TSX ARE WALKED THROUGH STORAGE THE
     ACC IS SET TO 30, AND IS STEPPED BY THE FRN AND THE VALUE OF THE
     INSTRUCTION COUNTER IS PLACED IN XRC BY THE TSX INSTRUCTION,
     THESE VALUES ARE COMPARED FOR EVERY ADDRESS. THE TRUE VALUE OF
     THE LOCATION OF THE FRN IS KEPT IN XRA. ALL LOCATIONS IN CORE
     OTHER THAN THOSE OCCUPIED BY THE PROGRAM AND THE FRN AND THE TSX ARE
     CLEARED TO ZERO.

B.  AREA OF THE MACHINE REQUIRED

    17. ERROR STOP. THE ADDRESS IN THE ACCUMULATOR WAS NOT THE TWOS
        COMPLEMENT OF XRC, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE TXT
        INSTRUCTION. WHEN THE MACHINE STOPS HERE.

 	THE ADDRESS OF THE ACCUMULATOR IS THE LOCATION TO WHICH THE IC
        SHOULD HAVE STEPPED.

        XRA HAS THE ADDRESS FROM WHICH THE IC SHOULD HAVE STEPPED.

	PRESS START TO TRY THIS SAME ADDRESS OVER.

    NOTE -- ANY OTHER STOP WILL PROBABLY BE A HTR 0000. THIS INDICATES
            AN ADDRESSING FAILURE. XRA HAS THE TRUE VALUE OF THE
