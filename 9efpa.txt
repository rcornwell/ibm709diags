A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   This section provides a comprehensive test of the Extended Precision
   Floating Point arithmetic instructions.

   EMP         +0673     Extended Floating Multiply
   EDP         +0672     Extended Floating Divide and Proceed
   EUA         -0672     Extended Unnormalized Floating Add
   EAD         +0671     Extended Floating Add
   ESB         -0671     Extended Floating Subtract

B. METHOD OF TEST

   Section 2 assumes that ELD and EST as checked in Section 1 are
   functional.
   And extended instruction is given and the results are examined by
   fixed-point instructions. The results are checked by the Program Check
   Subroutine. The correct resutls of each test routine are found in the
   three octal locations following the TSX CHECK instruction.

C. PROGRAM CONTROL

   This program provides separate subroutines for controlling the operation
   of the program within the machine. These controls are grouped under the
   heading of MONITOR. Monitor is discussed under SUBROUTINE

      4. I/O CHECK LIGHT CONTROL

         The I/O check light is used in this program as an indication to
         the Manual Restart Control (Part 5 - MONITOR) that the manual
         reset button has been used.

         The I/O light is turned on at the beginning of each test routine.
         On a condtion of manual reset, the I/O lite is turned off to indicat
         to the manual restart routine that entry to subroutine was a legal one.

D. NORMAL STOPS

      NONE 

                                                                        9EFPA
                                                                        1-1.60
                                                                        PAGE 1.0003
                    SECTION 2

E. ERROR STOPS

   Both error stops are under control of the 9DEPR Diagnostic Print
   Routine.
          To stop - SSW 2 UP and SSW 3 DN.
             6517 - Error stop for entry with the TSX ERROR,4 instruction.
             6545 - Error stop for entry with the TSX ERROR-1,4 instruction.

   On all halts, an error bit code and true error location is provided in the
   SI REG.  See listing write-up preceding the Program Check Subroutine for
   bit code used.

   The four Sense Lites also provide error indications. See Part C of this
   write-up.

F. PROGRAM CONTROL AND ERROR PRINTOUTS

   1.  All printouts are under control of SSW 3.
   
   2.  All error printouts are under control of both SSW 2 and SSW 3 as
       standardized by the DEPR Error Print Subroutine.

   3.  Consult the write-up and listing of DEPR for detailed account of
       the diagnostic print subroutine.
 
   4.  The correct results of each test routine can be found in the three
       octal locations of the test routine.

   5.  See Page 1.0008 for example of program control and error printouts.

G. TEST ROUTINE FORMAT

   All the test routines in this program were written in the followuing format,
   exccept for the exceptions as noted.

   The main headings, arranged in order as they would appear in a test
   routine, refer to either a single symbolic instruction or a group of
   symbolic instructions.

   The brief discussion following a heading gives the purpose for using such
   heading in the format.

   1.  BCD 10PN
 
       To provide BCD word for operation location in 9DEPR.

                                                                        9EFPA
                                                                        1-1.60
                                                                        PAGE 1.0004
                    SECTION 2


   2.  TSX CLEAR,4
          Program control is transfered to MONITOR (Part 1) for
          checking program sequence. If program is operating in
          proper sequence, control is transferred to Part 2 of MONITOR
          for initializing. EXCEPTION: In first test routine, program
          sequence is not checked. Only initializing is done.

   3.  TEST ROUTINE INSTUCTIONS

   4.  TSX CHECK,4
          Control is tranferred to the Program Check Routine. This
          routine checks the results of this test routine with the correct
          results as provided in the following three locations. On an
          error indication, control is transferred or halt, SSW 1 and SSW 4 are
          interrogated.
          On a condition of no error indication, control is transferred
          to 4,4(TSX OK,4).

    5. THREE OCTAL LOCATIONS
          These locations contain the correct result of the test routine.
          OCT or PZE - Gives the OV, QP and Trap conditions.
          OCT        - Correct contents of ACC S-35.
          OCT        - Correct contents of MQ  S-35.

    6. TSX OK,4
          If test routine checks OK, control is transferred to 9DEPR
          for interrogation of SSW 1 and SSW 4.

    7. TRA X
          To provide return to beginning of test routine under control of
          SSW 1 or SSW 4 in 9DEPR. In our case, return is to TSX CLEAR,4.

       EXCEPTIONS:

       a)  In test routines that check for false trapping or divide check
           conditions - TSX ERROR - 1,4
                        NOP ADDRESS (Either DCTER or TRPER)

           On these above errrors, a print out will occur before the results
           of the test routine are checked. The NOP instruction gives
           the BCD word to be inserted in the operations part of the 9DEPR
           printout.

                                                                        9EFPA
                                                                        1-1.60
                                                                        PAGE 1.0005
                    SECTION 2


       b)  In Scoping Loop Routines -
              SWT 1 is provided for a closed loop on an extended instruction.
              Separate temporary (temp) locations are provided for each
              loop routine.

       c)  In Reliability Section (NxN/N)
              SWT 1 is provided for looping after each operation before
              the zero column is shifted left.

H. SUBROUTINE DESCRIPTIONS

   1. PROGRAM CHECK SUBROUTINE

      This subroutine checks the arithmetic results of each test routine.
      These arithmetic resutls are checked with data provided by the 
      test routine as found in the three locations following the TSX CHECK
      instruction.

      See write-up in listing on Page 86 for other comments.

   2. MONITOR
 
      Monitor is divided into six parts to include all program control
      subroutines used in this diagnostic program.

      Part 1   PROGRAM SEQUENCE CHECK

      This subroutine checks to see if program is following each test
      routine in proper sequence.  Only the three following conditions
      are considered by this subroutine as being proper sequences:

      a)  The repeating of a test routine when under control of
          SSW 1 or SSW 4.

      b)  Proceeding in sequence from each test routine to the next
          following test routine.

      c)  The condition of a manul transfer as set in machine from 
          the keys.

      This subroutine provides this program with the means for detecting
      random addressing errors.


                                                                        9EFPA
                                                                        1-1.60
                                                                        PAGE 1.0006
                    SECTION 2

      Part 2  RESET AND RETURN CONTROL

      This subroutine will reset all MF registers, turn off all sense
      lights, turn off MQ and AC OV triggers, set program into the 
      floating point trap mode, reset nullify trigger, turn off divide
      check trigger, clear test routine temporary locations, and
      initialize location zero.

      The beginning test location is set in SI REG to indicate error
      location for the divide check and trap failure errors.
      The I/O check light is turned on for the manual restart subroutine
      (Part 5).

      Part 3   SPACE SUBROUTINE

      This subroutine, under control of SSW 3, will print space error
      using the standard 9DEPR print routine. With SSW 2 DN, the
      error inidication is bypassed. After printing or halting, the
      program will return to last test routine that was completed in
      proper sequence.

      Part 4   PROGRAM START AND STOP CONTROL

      START - This portion of the subroutine fills all unused portions
              of storage with TSX SPACE,4. The pass and error
              count locations are cleared. The program will be
              identified with SSW 3 UP.

      STOP  - This portions of the subroutine provides program control
              after the completion of each program pass.
              With SSW 6 DN, the program counters are stepped and
              program returned to the beginning test routine. After
              100 program passes, with SSW 3 UP, a printout of total
              passes is provided.
              With SSW 6 UP, the load cards button is simulated to
              read in next diagnostic program. If SSW 3 is UP at the
              same time, a printout of statistics and total
              program passes is provided.


      Part 5   MANUAL RESTART CONTROL

      This subroutine, on a condition of manual reset with SSW 1 DN, will
      return the program to the test routine that was interrupted at the time
      of the manual reset. With SSW 1 UP, the program will return to the
      beginning test routine.

                                                                        9EFPA
                                                                        1-1.60
                                                                        PAGE 1.0007
                    SECTION 2

      The I/O check light is used to indicate to this subroutine that entry
      was due to manual reset. The I/O check light is turned on at the
      beginning of each test routine and is turned off only on a manual
      reset.

      On conditions that the I/O check light is not off or address of
      location zero is no 00001, this subroutine will transfer to Part 3
      to print sequence error from location 00002.

      Part 6   FLAOTING POINT TRAP CONTROL

      This subroutine provides program control of all traps that occured
      during operation of the test routines. On legal traps, the program
      is returned back to test routine that provided return address. On all
      legal traps, XRC should be zero.

      On a condition of a legal trap with XRC not zero, the program will
      printout error, under control of SSW 2 and SSW 3, before returning
      to the test routine. The printout uses the standard 9DEPR format
      with the designation of I TIME for the operation code.

      On a condition of entry to subroutine with no return address provided,
      this subroutine will determine whether error was due to a trapping or
      skipping condition. If program skipped to location 00001, program
      control is tranfered to SPACE subrouine. If program trapped to 
      location 00001, a printout under control of SSW 2 and SSW 3 is provided
      before program is returned to trap location address plus one.
