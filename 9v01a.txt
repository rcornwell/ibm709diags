A.  UNIT TESTED

    1.  PURPOSE OF TEST
        TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE CRT TEST PROGRAM.

    2.  METHOD OF TEST
        FIVE PATTERNS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE CRT. SENSE CAMERA IS UNDER SENSE
        SWITCH CONTROL. EACH PATTERN IS ALSO UNDER SENSE SWITCH CONTROL.

        PATTERN 1.  A UNION JACK WITH INTENSITY SPOTS AT THE CORNERS AND
                    MIDDLE.

        PATTERN 2.  A DOT CHECKERBOARD PATTERN, DOTS EVERY 100 OCTAL POSITIONS

        PATTERN 3.  AN AXIS INTENSITY PATTERN,
     
        PATTERN 4.  A DOT INTENSITY PATTERN,
     
        PATTERN 5.  FILM CREEP TEST

        AT LEAST ONE SENSE SWITCH MUST BE DEPRESSED. WITHOUT DEPRESSING
        A SENSE SWITCH PROGRAM LOOPS IN THE ROUTINE WHICH TEST SENSE
        SWITCHES. SENSE SWITCH SIX IN UP CONDITION LOOPS PROGRAM IN
        PATICULAR PATTERN SELECTED, BY DEPRESSING OTHER SENSE SWITCHES.

        THE CAMERA IS SENSED BY DEPRESSING SWITCH SIX. THE PROGRAM THEN STOPS
        AND WHEN START IS DEPRESSED THE PROGRAM AGAIN EXAMINES SENSE SWITCHES,
        IF SIX IS DOWN THE CAMERA IS SENSED AGAIN.
