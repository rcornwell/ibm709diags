                       TIMING AND CREEP TEST

                            729-1 TEST

A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

    1.  TO CHECK AND DISPLAY TIMMING GOVERNING TAPE STOP AND START
        MOTION IN FORWARD AND REVERSE DIRECTIONS.

    2.  THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS THREE MAJOR AND INDEPENDENT SECTIONS FOR
        TESTING -- 1, RESET AND LOAD CHANNEL TIMING. 2, INTER-RECORD
        GAP TIMING AND 3. WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATION TO DETERMINE
        THE DEGREE OF FORWARD OR BACKWARD CREEP

    NOTE -- THIS PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT UPON DATA TRANSMISSION FOR THE
        ACCURACY OF ITS MEASUREMENTS SO IT PRESUMES THE SUCCESSFUL
        OPERATION OF BASIC TAPE PROGRAMS IN THIS RESPECT.

B.  METHOD OF TEST

  1.    SECTION 1 -- RESET AND LOAD CHANNEL TIMING TEST CONSISTING OF
        FOUR ROUTINES.

        A.  TEST WRITE SELECT AT LOAD POINT.

            WITH THE TAPE POSITIONED AT LOAD POINT. A WRITE SELECT IS
            SENT TO TAPE, AN INDEX DELAY LOOP IS CARRIED OUT IN MAIN
            FRAME AND THEN THE RESET AND LOAD CHANNEL INSTRUCTION IS
            GIVEN.  THIS INDEX DELAY CORRESPONDS TO THE WRITE DELAYS SO
            AN I-O CHECK WILL OCCUR IF THE MACHINE TIMINGS ARE SHORT.

            SENSE SWITCH 5 UP WILL PERFORM A GO-NO GO TYPE OF CHECK WITH
            THE INDEX DELAY EQUAL TO NOMINAL PROGRAMMING TIMING.  ONLY
            FAILURE TO PASS THIS TIMING WILL CAUSE A PRINT OUT.

            SENSE SWITCH 5 DN WILL LOOP IN ROUTINE INCREASING THE
            DELAY UNTIL AN I-O CHECK OCCURS AND A PRINT OUT SHOWS THE
            MAXIMUM SUCCESSFULL TIME BETWEEN SELECT AND RESET LOAD
            CHANNEL.

        B.  PARALLEL ROUTINE FOR READ SELECT AT LOAD POINT.

        C.  PARALLEL ROUTINE FOR WRITE SELECT NOT AT LOAD POINT.

        D.  PARALLEL ROUTINE FOR READ SELECT NOT AT LOAD POINT.

                                                           3-15-59

  2.    SECTION 2 -- INTER-RECORD GAPE TIMING TEST.

            STARTING AT LOAD POINT, THIS SECTION WRITES ON TAPE A SERIES
            OF GROUPS OF RECORDS, WITH FOR MARKER RECORDS SURROUNDING
            THREE TEST GAPS IN EACH GROUP.  THE GAPS ARE GENERATED UNDER
            VARYING CONDITIONS, THEN ALL ARE MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE
            EFFECTS ON THE GAPS AND DISCLOSE TAPE MOTION WEAKNESSES.

            THESE GAPS ARE WRITTEN UNDER MOST ADVERSE CONDITIONS AND IN
            REPEATED GROUPS WHICH WOULD DEVELOP AS FOLLOWS --
\I9t05a-t0.png\i
        R1. RECORD R1, THE FIRST RECORD, INCREASES IN LENGTH WITH EACH
            RECORD GROUP.  THE NUMBER OF WORDS IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE
            NUMBER OF INDEX COUNTS USED TO GENERATE THE VARIABLE GAP, G2.
            ONE WORD IS WRITTEN FOR EACH TWO INDEX COUNTS OF DELAY. THE
            LAST WORD OF R1 CONTAINS A NUMBER CORRESPONDING TO THE
            NUMBER OF MILLISECONDS THE GO LINE WAS HELD DOWN BEFORE THE
            VARIABLE GAP, G2, WAS GENERATED. DURING READ THIS RECORD IS
            USED TO LOCATE POSITION ON TAPE TO FIND THE INITIAL POINT TO
            START MEASURING THE TEST GAPS.

        G1  GAP G1, THE FIRST TEST GAP, IS GENERATED AFTER THE GO LINE
            HAS BEEN DOWN 10 MILSEC.  THIS GAP IS A FUNCTION OF SINGLE
            SHOT TIMINGS USED IN STARTING TO WRITE AND START-STOP TIMING.

        R2. RECORD R2 IS A ONE WORD MARKER FOR GAP G1.  -10- RECORD

        G2. GAP G2 IS GENERATED AFTER THE GO LINE HAS BEEN HELD DOWN A
            VARIABLE LENGTH OF TIME.  IF TAPE GAPS VARY AS A FUNCTION OF
            PROGRAM, THIS GAP WILL VARY IN SIZE AS THE DELAY AND RECORD
            R1 INCREASE.
            GO DOWN TIME WILL VARY FROM 001.00 TO 005.00 MILSECS.

        R3. RECORD R3 IS A ONE WORD MARKER FOR GAP G2.  -V- RECORD

        G3. GAP G3 IS GENERATED WITH THE GO LINE EFFECTIVELY UP STEADILY.
            THIS GAP IS A FUNCTION OF SS TIMINGS ONLY AND NOT AFFECTED
            BY START-STOP TIME.  CONSEQUENTLY IF GAP G3 IS CORRECT THEN
            ANY VARIATION IN GAP G1 MUST BE DUE TO START-STOP TIME.

        R4. RECORD R4 IS A ONE WORD MARKER FOR GAP G3.  -O- RECORD

        G4. GAP G4 IS A UTILITY GAP USED AS A STOPPING POINT FOR THE
            TAPE. TAPE MUST BE READ IN CONTINUOUS FULL SPEED MOTION
            ACROSS THE TEST GAPS SO ALL CALCULATING AND PRINTING IS DONE
            AT THIS STOPPING POINT ON TAPE.


                                                           9 T 0 5
                                                           3-15-59
                                                           PAGE 1.003


            AFTER THIS GROUP OF RECORDS IS WRITTEN THE VARIABLE DELAY OF
            GO LINE DOWN IS INCREASED AND THE NEXT GROUP OF TEST GAPS
            AND RECORDS IS PUT ON TAPE.  THIS ACTION CONTINUES UNTIL THE
            VARIABLE DELAY REACHES ITS MAXIMUM OF 5.01 MILSECS.  - K+3 -

            EACH TAPE FRAME CALLED BY 9IOM WILL WRITE THEN REWIND WHILE
            THE NEXT FRAME WRITES.

            WHEN 168 GROUPS OF RECORDS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN, TAPE WILL
            REWIND AND READ ACROSS THE TEST GAPS AT FULL SPEED. THE
            TAPE MAY OR MAY NOT HESITATE DURING EACH FORTH GAP WITHOUT
            AFFECTING THE RESULTS SINCE THIS GAP IS NOT CHECKED.  EACH
            TEST GAP IS TIMED AND THE TIME CHECKED FOR EXCESSIVE LENGTH
            OR SHORTNESS.  IF IT EXCEEDS LIMITS THE ERROR WILL BE
            INDICATED AT THIS POINT -- MINIMUM GAP  008.50 MILSEC,
            MAXIMUM GAP  012.50 MILSEC.

            EACH GAP TIME IS ALSO SUMMARIZED AND AVERAGED AND THE RESULTS
            OF EACH OF THE THREE KINDS OF GAP ARE PRINTED OUT AFTER THE
            ENTIRE SERIES OF RECORD GROUPS HAS BEEN READ.

            OPTIONAL METHODS OF RUNNING UNDER SENSE SWITCH CONTROL ARE
            LISTED IN PARAGRAPH D2,

            FOLLOWING THE GAP TEST THE TAPE WILL BACKSPACE AND RE-READ
            THE LAST RECORD 50 TIMES. THE TIMES MEASURED BETWEEN READ
            SELECT AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST WORD ARE AVERAGED AND
            THIS IS PRINTED OUT.

     3. SECTION 3 -- WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE CREEP TEST

            THIS SECTION WRITES FOUR RECORDS -- 1, A 24 WORD RECORD.,
            2, A ONE WORD RECORD. 3, A ONE WORD RECORD, AND 4, A 64 WORD
            RECORD.
\I9t05a-t1.png\i
            THESE RECORDS ARE READ AND CHECKECD THE TAPE BACKSPACES
            TWO RECORDS AND RE-WRITES THE THIRD RECORD.  NEXT THE TAPE
            BACKSPACES ONE FILE, READS THE TAPE MARK, FIRST AND SECOND
            RECORDS AND MEASURES THE GAP BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD
            RECORDS.  AFTER THE THIRD RECORD HAS BEEN READ, ONE MORE
            WORD, WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE FOURTH RECORD, IS
            READ AND CHECKED FOR BEING A TAPE MARK.  IF THE TAPE IS ABLE

            CONTROL, SECTION 3.

            AFTER EACH BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATION THE GAP WHICH WAS TIMED
            IS CHECKED AGAINST SHORT OR LONG LIMITS AND THE READINGS ARE
            AVERAGED.  THE AVERAGE GAP TIME, INITIAL GAP TIME, NUMBER OF
            WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATIONS COMPLETED, AND BACKWARD OR
            FOREWWARD CREEP ARE PRINTED OUT.

            SENSE SWITCHES 1, 2, 3 AND 4 ARE ALSO USED BY THE MAIN
            PROGRAM OF 9T05.  HERE THEY ARE USED IN MUCH THE SAME WAYS
            TO ACCOMPLISH SIMILAR RESULTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

        SECTION 1 -- LOAD CHANNEL TIMING TEST

        A.  SWITCH 1 UP - PROCEED TO NEXT ROUTINE
            SWITCH 1 DN - LOOP CONTINUOUSLY IN EACH ROUTINE.

        B.  SWITCH 2    - NOT USED, EXCEPT BY 9DEPR

            SWITCH 5 DN - CHECK LOAD CHANNEL TIMING TILL FAILURE

       SECTION 2 -- INTER-RECORD GAP TIMING TEST

           DURING WRITE

       A.  SWITCH 5 UP - CONTINUE TO WRITE READ GROUPS
           SWITCH 5 DN - STOP WRITING RECORD GROUPS AND PROCEED TO NEXT
                         ROUTINE

                         NOTE -- SWITCH 5 IS CONSULTED AFTER EACH RECORD
                         GROUP IS WRITTEN AND IF IT IS DOWN AT THIS TIME
                         WRITING IS ENDED FOR THAT TAPE UNIT. THEREFORE
                         IF THE WRITE ROUTINE IS ENTERED WITH SWITCH 5
                         DOWN ONLY ONE RECORD GROUP CAN BE WRITTEN ON
                         THE TEST TAPE FRAME AND SO SWITCH 5 MUST BE UP
                         BEFORE PRESSING START AT THE HALT AT 00717 OR
                         ONLY ONE RECORD GROUP WILL BE WRITTEN ON THE

                         RECORDS READ

           NOTE -- IF PROGRAM HALTS AT RDA3, 01142, CONTINUOUSLY AFTER
                   PRESSING START, THE C.E. MAY LOWER SENSE SWITCH 5
                   AND BY PRESSING START TWICE WILL GO TO TEST THE
                   NEXT UNIT.

                   THIS HALT OCCURS WHEN THE PROGRAM LOSES ITS PLACE IN
                   READING A RECORD GROUP.

      SECTION 3 -- BACKSPACE WRITE CREEP TEST

      A.  SWITCH 1 UP - SHORT MAXIMUM BACKSPACE OPERATION COUNT

            3. THIRD LINE -- GO LINE DOWN VARIABLE TIME ----
                    THE RANGE IS THE RESULT OF THE THINGS MENTIONED IN
                    THE SECOND LINE PLUS THOSE IN THE FOURTH LINE.
                    RECOVERY OF DRIVING CIRCUITS AND THE INERTIA OF THE
                    START-STOP MECHANISM AT CRITICAL TIMINGS.

                    RANGE OF --
                    002.00 OR LESS IS GOOD
                    003.00 SHOULD RECEIVE PM
                    003.50 OR OVER MAY CAUSE TROUBLE

                    CHECK, IF ERRORS OCCUR IN THIS AREA -
                    WRITE DELAY SINGLE SHOT
                    DRIVE CAPSTANS
                    FORWARD START-STOP TIME

                    CONDITION OF START-STOP MECHANISM


            4. FOURTH LINE -- GO LINE DOWN ZERO TIME -----

                     THE LENGTH OF THE GAP IS DETERMINED BY THE WRITE
                     DELAY SINGLE SHOT AND SOMEWHAT BY THE DRIVE CAPSTANS.

                     THE RANGE IS THE RESULT OF THE TAPE CONTINUOUS
                     DRIVE MACHANISMS.

                     RANGE OF --
                     000.30 MILSEC IS VERY GOOD
                     000.70 IS FAIR
                     001.00 AND UP SHOULD RECEIVE PM
                     001.50 OF MORE MAY CAUSE TROUBLE

                     THE AVERAGE WILL BE VERY CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL WRITE
                     DELAY SINGLE SHOT TIMING.

                     CHECK, IF ERRORS OCCUR IN THIS AREA -
                     WRITE DELAY SINGLE SHOT
                     BINDS, CUTS OR DIRT IN OR ON THE DRIVE CAPSTANS

                     CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN AVERAGE FROM ONE READING TO
                     ANOTHER OR CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN SUBSEQUENT
                     READINGS AT ONE TIME WILL PROBABLY BE AN EARLY
                     INDICATION OF WORN PARTS OR SLOPPY MECHANICAL
                     ADJUSTMENTS

D.  TERMINAL PRINT OUT

    AFTER THE INTER-RECORD GAP TEST AND THE BACKSPACE READ TEST
    ARE COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING PRINT OUT WILL APPEAR

    3.  SECTION 3 -- WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE CREEP TEST

         A. SUMMARY PRINT OUT

            ANY ONE OR A COMBINATION OF FOUR FACTORS CAN CAUSE THIS
            PRINT OUT.

            1.  COMPLETION OF 25 WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATIONS

                NOTE -- WITH SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN THIS WILL BE 100
                OPERATIONS COMPLETE

            2.  BACKWARD CREEP HAS REDUCED THE GAP TIME TO LESS THAN
                008.50 MILSECS

            3.  FORWARD CREEP HAS ALLOWED THE TERMINAL TAPE MARK TO
                BE READ

            4.  SENSE SWITCH 5 DOWN WILL CAUSE THE PRINT OUT AFTER EACH
                BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATION

 CHN C TF 01 025  BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATIONS COMPLETE   OK
  INITIAL GAP 011.24 MILSEC   AVG. FORWARD CREEP 000.70 MILSEC

            OK WILL APPEAR IN THE FIRST LINE IF THE AVERAGE FORWARD
            CREEP DOES NOT EXCEED 001.34 DECIMAL MILSECS WHICH EQUALS
            0.10 INCH

            INITIAL GAP IS THE TIME REQUIRED TO CROSS THE TEST GAP
            BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD RECORDS BEFORE ANY BACKSPACE-
            WRITE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED.

            AVERAGE CREEP IS THE CHANGE IN TIME REQUIRED TO CROSS THE
            RE-WRITTEN GAP PER WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATION AND IT
            IS SHOWN AS FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

            025 BACKSPACE-WRITE OPERATIONS SHOULD BE COMPLETED.

            ANY BACKWARD CREEP SHOULD BE ELIMINATED.

            FORWARD CREEP BETWEEN 000.50 AND 000.90 MILLISECONDS SHOULD
            ENSURE RELIABLE OPERATION. A TAPE WILL FORWARD CREEP OVER
            000.90 MILLISECONDS AVERAGE MAY LOSE COMPATIBILITY WITH A
            TAPE GENERATED ON OR FOR A 704 SYSTEM.

         B. TERMINAL PRINT OUT

            AFTER THE WRITE-BACKSPACE-WRITE TEST IS COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING
            PRINT OUT WILL APPEAR

CHN C TF 01   CREEP TEST COMPLETE


                                                           9 T 0 5
                                                           3-15-59
                                                           PAGE 1.016


    4. END OF TEST

       AFTER ALL UNITS ENTERED FROM KEYS HAVE BEEN TESTED, THE FOLLOWING
        PRINT OUT WILL OCCUR.


9T05  PASS COMPLETE   ALL UNITS


J.  COMMENTS

    1.  THE VISUAL CREEP ROUTINE MAY BE ENTERED  BY LOWERING SENSE SWITCH
        2 WHILE THE TAPE UNIT IS PERFORMING THE GAP TEST -- BY MANUALLY
        TRANSFERRING TO SYMBOLIC LOCATION CREEP - 02150

    2.  TIME FOR ENTIRE 9T05 IS 1 MIN. 15 SEC. PER TAPE UNIT IN MULTIPLE
        OPERATION.  TESTING A SINGLE TAPE UNIT WILL TAKE SLIGHTLY OVER
        THIS TIME PER DRIVE SINCE THE PROGRAM MUST WAIT FOR TAPE TO
        REWIND AFTER WRITING THE INTER-RECORD GAP TEST FILE.

    3.  9T05 SHOULD PROBABLY BE RUN AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH ON EACH TAPE
        FRAME.  EACH INSTALLATION WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE ITS OWN NEEDS.

        THE PRINT OUTS FOR EACH FRAME SHOULD BE KEPT OR SOME OTHER FORM
        OF RUNNING RECORD MAINTAINED.  COMPARISON OF READINGS WILL SHOW
        THE TENDENCIES OF EACH FRAME TOWARD FAILURE OR GOOD OPERATION
        AND SHOULD PRODUCE GOOD CONTROL OF EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE
        MAINTENANCE.
