                WORST CASE B TIME TEST



A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

    1.  Test maximum delay in B TIME and the 7090 channel priority
        circuit.

B.  METHOD OF TEST

    1.  A test of TAU operations is made on each channel selected.

    2.  A B TIME with concurrent ORS instruction execution test is made
        to check specifically and -AND circuit 3F on systems page 2.09.00.1

    3.  100 octal records consisting of 100 octal words are written, back-
        spaced, read and checked for errors on TAPE UNIT 2 CHANNEL A
        and TAPE UNIT 1 on each of the other channels selected.

    4.  If sense switch 5 is down, the program continuously stores the
        channel contents while reading information from tape.

    2.  Sense Switch Control

        a.  Use of sense switches 1 through 4 are as outlined in DEPRX.

        b.  Sense Switch 5 Up - Initially make 1 pass through entire
                                program except for continuous STORE
                                CHANNEL section and check sense switch 6.

        c.  Sense Switch 5 Dn - Repeat continuous STORE CHANNEL
                                routines.

        d.  Sense Switch 6 Up - Load next program.

        e.  Sense Switch 6 Dn - Repeat test (see section H-3)

E.  NORMAL STOPS

    1.  75320 - Enter keys for tape units on channels A-D

    2.  75334 - Enter keys for tape units on channels E-H

F.  ERROR STOPS

    1.  01436 - No tape units selected; press start to return to IOC.

    2.  02163 - Consult listing at this location for comments to aid
                in diagnosing error.

                                                            3/1/61
                                                            PAGE 3



    3.  75326 - Control word entered at location 75320 contained no tag
                bits for channels.

    4.  76471 - Error while executing routines of 9B53.

G.  PRINTOUTS

    1.  Program identification is printed on the initial pass with sense 
        switch 3 up.

    2.  Pass complete is printed for each pass through program with
        sense switches 3 up and 6 down.

    3.  For errors while executing routines of 9B53, DEPRX printouts
        will result with sense switch 3 up.

H.  COMMENTS

    1.  For worst case test use 729 MOD IV tape frames.

    2.  If the contents of any channel becomes larger than it should, the
        channel will be reset and a halt will occur. The comments in the
        listing following location 02162 may be an aid in determining the
        trouble.

    3.  With sense switch 5 up and 6 down, the return is to the beginning
        of the program. To repeat the TAU operations and B TIME-ORS
        tests, manually store a NOP instruction in location 00542 or the
        above tests will be omitted after the initial pass.

    4.  For TAU operations and B TIME-ORS tests, only TAPE UNIT 2
        on CHANNEL A is used but any number of units can be called for
        on other channels selected.

    5.  For WORST CASE routines, TAPE UNIT 2 on CHANNEL A and
        TAPE UNIT 1 on all other channels selected are the only drives
        used.

    6.  The sign key is used to designate the type of loading for the simulated
        load button sequence under sense switch 6 control.

    7.  To write this card deck program on a diagnostic program tape, only
        the loader must be replaced.
