                          9 T 0 4 A

A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

     1.  TO CHECK ACCURACY OF INFORMATION WRITTEN ON ONE TAPE FRAME
         AND READ ON ANOTHER


B.  METHOD OF TEST

     1.  THIS PROGRAM WRITES 400 RANDOM LENGTH, RANDOM WORD
         RECORDS. THEN READS AND CHECKS THESE RECORDS AND REWINDS.
         HERE THE PROGRAM HALTS TO PERMIT THIS TAPE REEL TO BE
         PLACED ON A DIFFERENT FRAME TO BE READ AND CHECKED.

     2.  THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN FOR UNIT 1 ON CHANNEL A AND
         USES 9IOM TO ADJUST FOR DESIRED CHANNELS

     3.  THIS PROGRAM USES THE STANDARD 709 ERROR PRINT ROUTINE
         9DEPR FOR ERROR INDICATION AND PROGRAM CONTROL.

C.  AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

     1.  UNITS   MF, CF, CR, PR, DS AND TAPE UNITS TO BE TESTED

     2.  STORAGE LOCATIONS   00000 TO 02233  9T04 DIAGNOSTIC

     2.  SENSE SWITCH CONTROL

         SENSE SWITCHES 1, 3, 3, AND 4 ARE USED BY 9DEPR. SEE
         WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEIR USE
         WHICH IS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS

        A.  SWITCH 1 UP - TEST SENSE SWITCH 4

            SWITCH 1 DN - REPEAT TEST LOOP

        B.  SWITCH 2 UP - INDICATE ERROR - TEST SSW3 TO
                          PRINT OR HALT

            SWITCH 2 DN - BYPASS ERROR INDICATION - TEST SSW1

        C.  SWITCH 3 UP - PRINTOUT IF SSW 2 UP THEN TEST SSW1

            SWITCH 3 DN - STOP ON ERROR. IF SSW2 IS UP, THEN
                          TEST SSW1

        D.  SWITCH 4 UP - PROCEED TO NEXT TEST ROUTINE

            SWITCH 4 DN - REPEAT SECTION N TIMES, OR IF ERROR
                          OCCURS TO NEXT SECTION.

        E.  SWITCH 5 UP - GO TO 9IOM TO ADJUST PROGRAM
                          FOR NEXT CHANNEL OR UNIT

            SWITCH 5 DN - HALT - THEN PRESS START TO
                          REPEAT READ ON SAME CHANNEL

        F.  SWITCH 6 UP - END TEST - CALL IN NEXT PROGRAM

            SWITCH 6 DN - TEST SSW 5

E.  NORMAL STOPS

     1.  STOPS AT BEGINNING OF PROGRAM TO ENTER ON KEYS THE
         CONTROL WORDS FOR CHANNELS AN UNITS USED IN
         MODIFICATION ROUTINE 9IOM. ONE, TWO OR THREE STOPS
         WILL OCCUR CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF DS TO BE TESTED
         AS SPECIFIED BY THE TAG BITS OF THE FIRST CONTROL WORD.

              A TAG OF 1 SPECIFIES CHN A AND/OR B
              A TAG OF 2 SPECIFIES CHN C AND/OR D
              A TAG OF 4 SPECIFIES CHN E AND/OR F

         IF MORE THEN ONE DS IS TO BE TESTED, THEN THE FIRST



                                                           9T04A

         CONTROL WORD SHOULD CONTAIN A MULTIPLE TAG.

         05517   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR FIRST DS ON KEYS
                 TAG FOR ALL DS TO BE TESTED
                 PRESS START

         05533   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHN C AND/OR D
                 PRESS START

         05540   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHN E AND/OR F
                 PRESS START

         05525   CONTROL WORD FAILED TO CONTAIN A TAG FOR ANY
                 DS. RE-ENTER FIRST CONTROL WORD WITH TAG
                 PRESS START

         SEE CONTROL WORD FORMAT

         NOTE -  ONLY 1 TAPE FRAME PER CHANNEL SHOULD BE
                 CALLED FOR IN CONTROL WORDS


F.  ERROR STOPS

     1.  9DEPR ERROR INDICATION STOPS WITH SSW3 DOWN

         06517   INDEX REGISTER C CONTAINS THE TWOS COMPLEMENT
                 OF THE ERROR EXIT ADDRESS.  READ LIGHTS THAT ARE
                 OUT AND ADD 1 AND CONSULT THAT ADDRESS IN PROGRAM
                 LISTING FOR ERROR ANALYSIS.

         06545   SAME AS ABOVE
                 PUSH START TO CONTINUE PROGRAM


G.  ERROR PRINT OUTS

         SEE WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR EXAMPLE AND DESCRIPTION
         OF PRINT OUT.


         TEST LOC IS ADDRESS OF ENTRY TO ROUTINE IN WHICH
         ERROR OCCURRED. OPN IS THE INSTRUCTION MOST BASIC
         TO THE CONDITION BEING TESTED IN FAILING ROUTINE.
         ERROR ADR IS THE EXIT FROM THE FAILING ROUTINE TO
         9DEPR.

H.  COMMENTS

     1.  TWO POST RESTARTS ARE USED IN THIS PROGRAM. DURING
         WRITE THE RESTART WILL RETURN TO THE BEGINNING OF


                                                           9T04A
                                                           7-01-58

         THE WRITE SECTION AND DURING READ TO THE BEGINNING
         OF THE READ SECTION.
         ANY TIME THE CONSOLE IS RESET, PRESSING START WILL
         TRANSFER THE PROGRAM TO BEGIN TESTING THE CURRENT
         FRAME.

     2.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE ERROR PRINT
         OUT IS THE ERROR ADR. BY REFERRING TO THIS ADDRESS
         IN THE PROGRAM LISTING. THE ROUTINE WHICH FAILED MY BE
         LOCATED. BY ANALYZING THE ROUTINE WITH THE AID OF THE
         PROGRAM COMMENTS. IT IS HOPED THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER
         WILL BE ABLE TTO DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MACHINES
         FAILED AND SO HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO DIAGNOSE
         THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION.

J.  TABLE OF TEST ROUTINES AND ADDRESSES OF ENTRY
    IN ORDER OF PERFORMANCE

     1.  WRITE RANDOM BINARY RECS             BEGINS AT     00066

     2.  READ CHECK RANDOM RECS               BEGINS AT     00153
