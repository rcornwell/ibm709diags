E.  EXAMPLE OF PRINTOUT

 ERROR ADDRESS 75570 ERROR WORD 000 000 000 000 000 000 100 000 000 000 000 001
 ERROR EXIT    00060  TEST WORD 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
 BEAT ADDRESS  75610  BEAT WORD 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111
 LOCATION OF SWITCH CORES- Y3 MATRIX ROW 7, COL 1- X2 MATRIX ROW 8, COL 8

        THE PRINT OUT IS SELF EXPLANATORY. THE FIRST LINE CONTAINS THE ADDRESS

                                                           9S04HA-LA
                                                           7-01-58

        OF THE WORD THAT FAILED, AND THE WORD AT THAT LOCATION.

        THE SECOND LINE CONTAINS THE ERROR EXIT, AND THE CORRECT WORD. THE THIRD
        LINE CONTAINS THE BEAT ADDRESS, AND THE BEAT WORD.

        THE FOURTH LINE CONTAINS THE LOCATION OF THE SWITCH CORES THAT SELECT
        THE ADDRESS IN ERROR.

        IN THE EXAMPLE THE WORD AT ADDRESS 75570 PICKED UP A BIT IN POSITIONS
        18 AND 35. THIS ADDRESS IS SELECTED BY THE Y3 AND X2 SWITCH CORE
        MATRIXES. THE 2 SWITCH CORES ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED AT THE 7TH ROW AND
        THE 1ST COLUMN OF THE Y3 MATRIX, AND THE 8TH ROW AND THE 8TH COLUMN OF
        THE X2 MATRIX.

F.  COMMENTS

    1.  EACH ADDRESS IN TURN IS WRITTEN WITH A TEST WORD A NUMBER OF TIMES AND
        THEN 16 ADDRESSES ARE CHECKED TO SEE IF THEY STILL RETAIN ZERO.  THE 16
        ADDRESSES WHICH ARE CHECKED ARE THOSE MOST LIKELY TO PICK UP A BIT
        DURING WRITE TIME. THEY ARE CORES SHARING THE SAME SELECT LINE AS THE
        TEST ADDRESS AND ALSO SHARING THE SELECT LINES WHICH CONTAIN NOISE FROM
        THE CORE DRIVERS AT WRITE TIME. UNDER SENSE SWITCH CONTROL IT IS
        POSSIBLE TO BEAT EACH ADDRESS 500, 1000, OR 5000 TIMES.

    2.  THE SPEED OF THE PROGRAM IS 8 MINUTES TO RUN ONE HALF OF THE TEST WHEN
        RUN WITH SENSE SWITCHES 4 AND 5 UP 500 BEATS PER ADDRESS, AND USING
         THE TEST WORD 777777777777 AND A ROTATION COUNT OF 1.

    3.  THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER A CHOICE IN THE
        METHOD OF TESTING THE MACHINE. THE TEST WORD AND THE ROTATION COUNT CAN
        BE CHANGED TO SATISFY ANY NUMBER OF CONDITIONS.
       
        EXAMPLE A
            TO TEST EACH CORE INDIVIDUALLY THE TEST WORD CAN BE CHANGED AND THE
            ROTATION COUNT ADJUSTED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, HOWEVER, THIS WOULD
            REQUIRE AN EXTREMELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO RUN.

        B   A PRATICAL TEST WOULD BE TO CHANGE THE TEST WORD TO 010101010101
            AND THE ROTATION COUNT TO 6. THIS WOULD CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO GO
            THROUGH THE TEST 6 TIMES. EACH TIME THROUGH THE TEST THE MQ WOULD BE
            ROTATED ONE UNIT. THUS THE MACHINE WOULD BE TESTED WITH THE
            FOLLOWING WORDS
                           010101010101 - 1ST PASS
                           020202020202 - 2ND PASS
                           040404040404 - 3RD PASS
                           010101010101 - 4TH PASS
                           020202020202 - 5TH PASS
                           040404040404 - 6TH PASS

        C   AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROGRAM EACH CORE WOULD BE TESTED ONE
            TIME. EVERY 6TH PLANE IN THE CORE ARRAY WOULD BE TESTED AT THE SAME

                                                           9S04HA-LA
                                                           7-01-58
                                                           PAGE 1.004

            TIME. THIS WOULD REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 48 MINUTES TO RUN ONE HALF
            OF THE TEST.

        D.  ANY TYPE OF PATTERN CAN BE USED TO TEST MEMORY BY CHANGING
            SYMBOLIC LOCATIONS ZERO /01403-77467/ AND TEST 2 /01371-77455/ OR
            ONE /1404-77470/ AND TEST 1 /01370-77454/.

        E   BY PUTTING SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO LOOP
            AND TEST MEMORY WITHOUT LOADING MEMORY EACH TIME.

        F   TO BEAT A SMALL PORTION OF MEMORY PUT SENSE SWITCH ONE DOWN AND
            ADJUST THE WORDS AT LOCATIONS LOW AND HIGH. 1372 AND 1373, OR 77456
            AND 77457, TO BEAT A PORTION OF MEMORY FROM 25010 TO 26500, PUT
            25010 IN LOCATION LOW AND 26500 IN LOCATION HIGH. TO RETURN THE
            PROGRAM TO ORIGINAL STATUS JUST PUT SENSE SWITCH 1 UP AND THE LOW
            AND HIGH VALUES WILL BE RESTORED TO THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM VALUES.
 
    4.  THE ROTATION COUNT AT K6, 1367 OR 77453, CAN BE MADE AS HIGH AS 44 AND
        THE TEST WORD CAN BE MADE 1. THIS WILL CORRECTLY TEST MEMORY EXCEPT
        FOR THE SIGN POSITION, THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AT ALL TIMES
        THE TEST WORD SHOULD CONTAIN AT LEAST TWO BINARY BITS. THIS WILL INSURE
        THAT ALL CORES INCLUDING THE SIGN POSITIONS ARE BEING TESTED. REMEMBER
        TO TEST IN THIS MANNER WILL REQUIRE AN EXTREMELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
