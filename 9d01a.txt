                    DRUM DIAGNOSTIC AND RELIABILITY TEST
                            ALSO DRUM SPEED TEST

A. UNIT TEST

   1. PURPOSE OF TEST

      A.  TO COMPLETELY TEST AND DIAGNOSE ALL DRUM FAILURES. THE TEST WILL
          OPERATE CORRECTLY TO TEST UP TO 16 LOGICAL DRUMS,---4 DRUM FRAMES.
   
B. METHOD OF TEST

   PART I            INITIALIZATION           0030 - 0415

       1.  THE KEYS ARE USED FOR SELECTING THE DESIRED DRUM OR DRUMS TO BE 
           TESTED.

           KEY 1, DRUM 1-KEY 2, DRUM 2-KEY 3, DRUM 3-------KEY 16, DRUM 16.
   
       2.  SENSE LIGHTS ARE USED TO INDICATE WHICH DRUM IS BEING TESTED.
           SENSE LIGHT 4 IS USED THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM FOR CONTROL,
           SEE SENSE LIGHT SECTION

       3.  SINCE THE LOAD DRUM TEST WORKS ONLY ON DRUM 1 AND SINCE IT IS ONLY
           NECESSARY TO ENTER THIS TEST ONCE, IT IS BYPASSED ON EVERY TEST
           EXCEPT THE INITIAL TEST WHEN DRUM ONE IS BEING TESTED. LOAD DRUM
           TEST MAY BE ENTERED ONLY ON INITIAL PASS, HOWEVER, A MANUAL TRA TO
           0032 WILL RELOAD THIS COUNT, OR A HIGHER COUNT MAY BE STORED IN
           CT4 AT LOCATION 0032.
 
       4.  WHEN THE CORRECT DRUM TO BE TESTED HAS BEEN SELECTED, THIS DRUM
           ADDRESS IS STORED IN ALL RDS AND WRS INSTRUCTIONS. TEST
           INSTRUCTIONS, RDR, AND LDA, ARE ALSO ADJUSTED FOR PRINT OUT WITH
           9DEPRA, DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING PRINT SUBROUTINE.

   PART II         TEST LOAD DRUM               0416 - 0436

       1.  WRITE TWO TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS ON DRUM 301 AT LOCATIONS ZERO AND
           ONE. THEN PROGRAM STOPS TO ALLOW PUSHING LOAD DRUM BUTTON. CORRECT
           TRANSFER INSTRUCTION WILL THEN PLACED IN ZERO AND TRANSFER TO 
           LOAD 1 AFTER DRUM DISCONNECTS. LOCATION 1 IS ALSO CHECKED TO SEE IF
           CORRECT WORD WAS PLACED THERE.

   PART III A      ALL ZEROS TEST               0443 - 0513


                                                                   9D01A
                                                                   7-01-58
                                                                   PAGE 1.002


       1.  LOAD ENTIRE DRUM WITH ZERO WORDS.
   
       2.  READ ENTIRE DRUM INTO COMMON STORAGE TO INSURE THAT READING DOES
           NOT AFFECT STORED INFORMATION.

       3.  READ ENTIRE DRUM INTO RESERVEED MEMORY AREA AND COMPARE EACH WORD
           WITH TEST WORD OF ALL ZEROS.

       4.  OUR NEW DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING PRINT SUBROUTINE IS IN COMPLETE
           CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AND EXIT IS MADE, AFTER EACH TEST. TO
           9DEPRA, WHETHER ON ERROR OR OK. SEE PRINT ROUTINE SECTION.
   
   PART III B      ALL ONES TEST                 0443 - 0513

       1.  THIS TEST REPEATS INSTUCTIONS FOR PART III A EXACTLY EXCEPT THE
           TEST WORD IS ALL ONES INSTEAD OF ZEROS.

   PART IV         SLIVER ANA CPY, TIMING TEST   0514 - 0533

       1.  A COPY LOOP IS SET UP WITH AN ANA INSTRUCTION INSERTED BETWEEN
           COPIES, THIS COPY ANA COPY SEQUENCE IS TO CHECK FOR A CLOSE
           TIMING CONDITION.

       2.  A 2 CYCLE INSTRUCTION, NOP, MAY BE MANUALLY INSERTED IN PLACE OF
           THE 3 CYCLE ANA. IF YOU DESIRE TO FIND THE MAXIMUM TIME BETWEEN
           COPIES, A SHIFT INSTRUCTION MAY BE USED, THE SHIFT BEING INCREASED
           UNTIL I/O CHECK OCCURS.

   PART V          SHORT LDA TEST                0534 - 0576

       1.  THIS TEST IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE REGULAR SHORT LDA TEST.
           THIS SMALL LDA TEST IS WRITTEN PRIMARILY TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE
           LDA PATTERN USED IN THE TEST TO FOLLOW, THE WORST PATTERN TEST. SO
           THAT WHEN RUNNING THE WORST PATTERN TEST THE POSSIBILIYT OF GETTING
           AN LDA ERROR OR CONFUSING A WORST PATTERN ERROR WITH AN LDA ERROR
           WILL BE ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATED.

   PART VI         WORST PATTERN TEST            0577 - 0674

       1.  DRUM TO BE TESTED IS REWRITTEN WITH ALL ZEROS.

       2.  FORTY ONE TEST WORDS. A WORD OF ALL ZEROS EXCEPT FOR A ONE IN ONE OF
           ITS 36 POSITIONS, ARE WRITTEN ON DRUM BEGINNING AT DRUM ADDRESS ZERO
           AND AT EVERY SIXTY TWO OCTAL ADDRESSES THAT FOLLOW. THE TEST
           WORD BEGINS WITH A ONE IN POSITION 35 AND IS ROTATED LEFT ONE 
           POSITION FOR EACH NEW ADDRESS.

       3.  THESE 41 TEST WORDS ARE READ BACK ONE AT A TIME AND CHECKED FOR
           ERROR.

       4.  THE DRUM IS REWRITTEN WITH ALL ONES AND THE TEST WORDS ARE CHANGED

                                                                   9D01A
                                                                   7-01-58
                                                                   PAGE 1.003

           SIMILARILY TO ALL ONES EXCEPT FOR ONE POSITION IN THE WORD WHICH IS 
           A ZERO. THE TEST IS REPEATED.

   PART VII       TIMING PULSE TEST              0675 - 1001

       1.  THE ENTIRE DRUM IS LOADED BEGINNING AT SOME DRUM ADDRESS OTHER 
           THEN ZERO, AT DRUM ADDRESS 3472 IN PART 1 OF THIS TEST. AT DRUM
           ADDRESS 3472 ALL ONES ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE REMAINDER OF THE DRUM
           IS LOADED WITH ZEROS.

       2.  DRUM ADDRESSES 3472, 3777, AND ZERO ARE CHECKED FOR ERRORS.
   
       3.  THE DRUM IS RELOADED BEGINNING AT ADDRESS 307. ALL ONES ARE WRITTEN
           AT 307, THE REMAINDER OF THE DRUM IS LOADED WITH ZEROS, AND A 25
           PATTERN IS WRITTEN OVER ADDRESS 307.
   
       4.  DRUM ADDRESS 307 IS CHECKED FOR ERROR.
   
   PART VIII     LOCATE DRUM ADDRESS TEST        1002 - 1210
   
       1.  SEQUENTIAL TEST

       A.  LOAD ENTIRE DRUM WITH GENERATED NUMBERS CORRESPONDING TO EACH
           LOCATION OF DRUM ADDRESS, ---ADDRESSES AT ADDRESSES.

       B.  READ ENTIRE DRUM INTO STORAGE, IN SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THA IS
   
           0001, 0401, 1001, ........, 3401,
           0002, 0402, 1002, ........, 3402,

           0000, 0400, 1000, ........, 3400,
   
       C.  COMPARE WORD READ TO CORRESPONDING GENERATED WORD TO BE SURE
           CORRECT INFORMATION WAS WRITTEN ON DRUM.
   
       D.  A CHECK SUM IS KEPT OF GENERATED WORDS FOR A MORE THOROUGH CHECK.
   
       E.  LOCATE ALL DRUM ADDRESSES FOLLOWING SEQUENCE PATTERN IN-2-ABOVE.
           BY GENERATING THE CORRECT DRUM ADDRESS. COMPATE ADDRESS LOCATION TO
           WORD STORED AT THIS LOCATION TO BE SURE CORRECT ADDRESS WAS FOUND.

       2.  NON-SEQUENTIAL TEST

           A  SAME AS SEQUENTIAL TEST EXCEPT INSTEAD OF TESTING LDA
              SEQUENTIALLY EVERY TWENTIETH OCTAL ADDRESS IS TESTED. THIS MAKES
              THE TEST MUCH SHORTER. WHERE IN THE SEQUENTIAL TEST ONLY ONE DRUM
              ADDRESS MAY BE TESTED, PER DRUM REVOLUTION. IN THIS MANNER

                                                                   9D01A

       1.  ALL DRUM IN THE FRAME SELECTED ARE LOADED WITH A 25 PATTERN.
    
       2.  ONE WORD IS WRITTEN ON EACH DRUM IN ASCENDING LDA ADDRESSES.
   
       3.  EACH LDA WORD IS READ BACK AND CHECK.
   
       4.  IF AN ERROR OCCURS ONLY IN THIS SECTION, THE TROUBLE IS PROBABLY
           IN MF3 J06 TUBES 7 AND 8. SYSTEMS PAGE 7.01.
   
   PART X        WORST SWITCHING CONDITIONS TEST    1452 - 1710

       1.  ALL DRUMS IN THE FRAME FO THE DRUM SELECTED TO BE TESTED ARE LOADED
           TWICE WITH THE LOAD PATTERN. INCLUDING THE DRUM TO BE TESTED. THIS
           TENDS TO GIVE A MAXIMUM SIGNAL LEVEL SPILL.

       2.  THE DRUM TO BE TESTED IS THEN LOADED ONCE WITH THE TEST PATTERN,
           THE TEST PATTER BEING THE ALTERNATE OF THE LOAD PATTERN. THIS
           GIVES A MINIMUM SIGNAL LEVEL AND SPILL.

       3.  READ TEST DRUM INTO STORAGE.
   
       4.  COMPARE WORD READ TO TEST WORD.
   
       5.  THE LOAD AND TEST WORDS ARE REVERSED AND THE TEST IS REPEATED.

       6.  TWO TEST WORDS, 252525252525 AND 525252525252, ARE USED FOR LOAD
           PATTERN, TEST PATTERN, AND TEST WORDS. THE DRUMS ARE LOADED IN SUCH
           A WAY AS TO HAVE THESE WORDS ALTERNATING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DRUM
           FROM 0-3777 THEN THE DRUM TO BE TESTED IS LOADED IN THE SAME MANNER
           BUT WITH THE TEST WORDS BEGIN REVERSED. THE TEST WORDS ARE STORED
           AT LOCATIONS 2351 AND 2352 RESPECTIVELY.

       7.  AN ADDITIONAL TEST IS PREFORMED, USING 707070007070 AND
           070707770707 AS TEST WORDS. THESE WORDS ARE FOUND AT LOCATIONS 
           2353 AND 2354.

   PART X        RANDOM NUMBER TEST              1451 - 1665
   
     1.   RANDOM NUMBER LDA TEST

       A.   THE SELECTED DRUM TO BE TESTED IS FULLY LOADED WITH ALL ZEROS.
   
       B.   GENERATE 100 OCTAL RANDOM NUMBERS AND WRITE ON DRUM BEGINNING AT
            A GENERATED RANDOM ADDRESS. FINISH LOADING DRUM WITH ALL ZEROS.

       C.   READ ENTIRE DRUM INTO STORAGE AND CHECK RANDOM NUMBER WRITTEN AT
            FIRST RANDOM ADDRESS, THE LAST-ONE HUNDRETH OCTAL-RANDOM NUMBER, AND

                                                                   9D01A

            RANDOM NUMBER WRITTEN AT ZERO ON DRUM IF ANY. A RANDOM NUMBER WILL
            BE WRITTEN AT ZERO ON DRUM ONLY WHEN RANDOM ADDRESS IS GREATER THEN
            ADDRESS 3700.

       D.   CHECK SUMS ARE GENERATED AND CHECKED TO LESSEN CHANCE OF ERROR

       E.   CAD IS USED IN THIS AREA TO READ + WRITE. THE READ CHECK SUM
            IS COMPARED AGAINST THE CAD SUM. THE WRITE CHECK SUM IS COMPARED
            AGAINST THE CAD WRITE. THEY ARE ALSO COMPARED AGAINST EACH OTHER.
            AS TEST WORDS. THESE WORDS ARE FOUND AT LOCATIONS 
            2353 AND 2354.

     2.   RANDOM NUMBER TEST-FULL DRUM     2126 - 2210

       A.   GENERATE 4000 OCTAL RANDOM NUMBERS AND WRITE DRUM THREE TIMES.

            THIS SECTION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE INDEX GAP TO WRITE THE DRUM
            THREE TIMES WITHOUT RESELECTING. THE TIME USED IN THE GAP IS 
            72 US. IF THE I/O CHECK COMES ON, THE INDEX GAP IS MUCH TOO SHORT
            AND THE DRUM TIMMING TRACKS SHOULD BE RE-WRITTEN.

            GENERATE 4000 OCTAL RANDOM NUMBERS AND WRITE DRUM ONES.

       B.   READ FULL DRUM BACK INTO STORAGE AND CHECK FOR ERROR.
   
   PART XII            552 U-SEC DELAY         2211 - 2226
                       BETWEEN RDS AND LDA

       1.  AN RDS IS GIVEN AND A 552 U-SEC DELAY SET UP BEFORE THE LDA IS
           GIVEN. ONLY ONE CPY IS GIVEN AND ONLY ONE PASS PROGRAMMED.

   1.  A RESTART IS FURNISHED BY PLACING A TRA 34 AT LOCATION 0.
   
   2.  9D01 DEPENDS UPON THE RELIABILITY OF STORAGE. THEREFORE, STORAGE MUST
       BE USED AS A BUFFER AND ANY STORAGE FAILURE WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A 
       DRUM FAILURE.
   
   3.  THE SPEED OF THE PROGRAM IS APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES PER PASS FOR ALL
       4 DRUMS WHEN RUNNING THE LONG LDA TEST AND APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES
       WHEN RUNNING SHORT LDA TEST.
   
   4.  THE PROGRAM IS WRITTEN SUCH THAT ON ERROR PRINT OUT THE WORD NUMBER
       WILL BE THE SAME AS THE LOCATION ON DRUM WHERE ERROR OCCURED. IF AN
       ERROR OCCURS ON A CHECK SUM TEST, THE RECNO AND WDNO SHOULD BE IGNORED.
   
   5.  THE RECORD NUMBER IN THE ERROR PRINT OUT WILL ALWAYS BE 1.
   
   6.  IF THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER WISHES TO TRACE PULSES IN A CERTAIN DRUM FRAME,
       HE MAY MANUALY TRANSFER TO 447 AND STO MANUALLY DESIRED PATTERN IN
       T1, LOCATION 2627. THE DIFFERENT PATTERNS USED IN THE TEST ARE-
   
       TEST 1 IS LOCATION 2615 AND CONTAINS ALL ZEROS.
       TEST 2 IS LOCATION 2616 AND CONTAINS ALL ONES.
       TEST 3 IS LOCATION 2617 AND CONTAINS 252525252525.
       TEST 4 IS LOCATION 2620 AND CONTAINS 525252525252.
       TEST 5 IS LOCATION 2621 AND CONTAINS 707070007070.
       TEST 6 IS LOCATION 2622 AND CONTAINS 070707770707.
       
       ANY OTHER PATTERN THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER WISHES MAY BE USED.
   
       A CONTINUOUS WRITE LOOP WILL BE WHEN TRANSFER IS MADE TO 
       447 AND SSW 1 SET DOWN.
   
       A CONTINUOUS READ LOPP MAY BE PERFORMED WHEN TRANSFER IS MADE TO 456 AND
       SSW 1 SET DOWN.
   
       A CONTINUOUS READ AND COMPARE LOOP MAY BE PERFORMED BY TRANSFERING
       TO 465 AND SETTING SSW 1 DOWN.
   
   7.  BY STORING A TRANSFER TO 0443 AT LOCATION 0507 THE ONES AND ZEROS TEST
       WILL BE RUN CONTINUALLY ON ANY DESIRED DRUM. ANY OTHER TEST MAY BE
       SET UP SIMILARLY.
   
   8.  TO RUN THE SWITCHING TEST REQUIRES THAT ALL DRUM IN FRAME SELECTED BE

                                                                   9D01A
                                                                   7-01-58
                                                                   PAGE 1.008

       IN WORKING CONDITION. THAT IS THEY MUST BE IN CONDITION TO BE SELECTED,
       WRITTEN ON, AND READ FROM. OTHERWISE A TRA MUST BE MADE MANUALLY.
       STO A TRA TO 2421 AT LOCATION 1212 TO BYPASS THIS SECTION.
       SIMILARLY ANY PART OF 9D01 MAY BE BYPASSED. ALSO ANY ONE TEST CAN BE
       SINGLED OUT FOR INDIVIDUAL RUNNING.
   
   9.  IF WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM. WITH ALL DRUMS FOR YOUR
       INSTALLATION BEING SELECTED, AND YOU WANT TO MOVE THE PROGRAM TO A 
       PARTICULAR DRUM THEN MANUALLY TRA TO 72 AND START. THIS WILL CARRY YOU
       TO THE NEXT DRUM. SO CONTINUE THIS MANUAL TRA TO 72, AND START UNTIL
       THE SENSE LIGTHS TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE THE DRUM YOU WANT. ALSO, IF
       YOU WANT TO TEST THE DRUM OVER AND OVER YOU MAY STORE A TRA ATO AA LOC
       443 AT FINIS-1 -LOC 2421. YOU MAY AT ANY TIME STORE THE DRUM ADDRESS
       OF DRUM YOU WANT TO TEST AT LOC 2446 AND A ZERO AT 2447, OR YOU MAY
       RESTART AND ENTER ONLY 1 DRUM INTO KEYS.
   
   10. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT AN ERROR FOUND IN ONE TEST MAY SHOW UP
       IN A FOLLOWING TEST AS A DIFFERENT TYPE ERROR. THAT IS, A READ
       OR WRITE ERROR MAY SHOW UP FURTHER DOWN AS AN LDA ERROR. IN A 
       CASE LIKE THIS. THE FIRST LOCATION OF ERROR SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIORITY
       AND EXMAINED FIRST.

    E. COMMENTS

       1.  IN ORDER TO USE THIS PROGRAM IT IS NECESSARY TO CONNECT MF3
           R06-1, SYSTEMS PAGE 7.03 TO MF4 F02-3, SYSTEMS PAGE 5.05.03,
           BY MEANS OF A JUMPER WIRE.

       2.  BECUASE OF THE COMPLETE ASYNCHRONISM OF THE DRUM AND PROGRAM,
           IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS ANSWER TO RESULT.
           THIS WILL. HOWEVER, BE SO FANTASTIC THAT THE ERROR IS
           OBVIOUS. IT IS ADVISABLE TO CHECK EACH DRUM SEVERAL TIMES.

       3.  THE TIME REQUIRED FOR EACH PASS IS ABOUT 24 MILLISECONDS.
       
       4.  THIS TEST MUST BE TRANSFERRED INTO MANUALLY.

12. THE SPECIAL VERSION OF 9DEPR  FOLLOWS THE DRUM SPEED TEST LOC 7115

13. SPECIAL NOTE -- IF AN 8 HOUR RELIABILITY RUN, OR SOMTHING
                    COMPARABLE, IS DESIRIED, STORE A TRA TO 70 AT
                    LOCATION, CC-2, 0034.
