                   CARD READER TIMING AND RELIABILITY TEST
                                FOR MODEL 250

A. UNIT TESTED - 711 CARD READER

   1. PURPOSE OF TEST

      A. INITIALLY DETERMINE THE SPEED OF THE CARD READER PER CYCLE AND
         SUBSEQUENTLY TEST ALL PHASES OF TIMING TO DETERMINE MAXIMUM TIME
         BETWEEN VARIOUS OPERATIONS.

      B. TO DETERMINE RELIABILITY OF THE CARD READER WHILE REACHING FOR
         MAXIMUMN TIME BETWEEN VARIOUS OPERATIONS.

      C. TO DETERMINE RELIABILITY OF THE CARD READER BY CAUSING THE CARD
         READER TO INTERMITTENTLY LATCH UP.
   2. METHOD OF TEST

      A. KEYS 1-6 ARE USED TO INCREMENT TIMING, BETWEEN VARIOUS OPERATIONS

      B. WITH KEYS 1-6 UP, THE CARD READER READS EACH RECORD WITH NORMAL
         PROGRAMMING DELAYS.

      C. WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 DOWN, THE CARD READER IS INTERMITTENTLY
         LATCHED UP BETWEEN RECORDS.

   PER CYCLE.

D. NORMAL STOPS

   01146   NO PRINTER ON LINE AND MAXIMUM TIMING HAS BEEN REACHED FOR ALL
           OPERATIONS EXCEPT THE TIME BETWEEN 12 RIGHT TIME AND EOR.
   01147   NO PRINTER ON LINE AND MAXIMUM TIMING HAS BEEN REACHED BETWEEN 12
           RIGHT TIME AND EOR
   05517   ENTER CONTROL WORD IN KEYS TO INDICATE TESTING THE CARD READER AND
           THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS ON LINE.AT THIS STOP,TEST CARDS ARE
           TO BE RELOADED IN THE CARD READER IF MOER THEN ON PASS
           IS DESIRED.

E. ERROR STOP

   06545   WORD READ FROM CARD AND WORD IN STORAGE DID NOT COMPARE CORRECTLY.

F. PRINT-OUTS

   1. PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION IS PRINTED OUT INITIALLY IF A PRINTER IS ON
      LINE ON CHANNEL A.

   2. AFTER 300 RECORDS HAVE BEEN READ BY THE CARD READER, PASS COMPETE IS
      PRINTED OUT IF A PRINTER IS ON LINE ON CHANNEL A.

   3. TEST CARDS ARE PUNCHED TO INDICATE WHICH WORD FAILED IN A COMPARISION
      ERROR. THE DECIMAL SUM OF EVERY 2 OCTAL DIGITS EQALS THE WORD.
      THE ZERO ROW IS INDICATED BY THE DECIMAL SUM OF 10.

      EXAMPLES 9 ROW  9L 727272727272 9R 27272727272

      OF ALL PRINTOUTS.

G. COMMENTS

   1.  SEE PAGE 1 OF THE LISTING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO ENTER KEYS FOR
       TESTING OF CARD READERS ON A SINGLE OR MULTIPLE CHANNELS.

   2.  TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM TIMINGS BETWEEN VARIOUS OPERATIONS WITH NO 
       PRINTER ON LINE ON CHANNEL A, DISPLAY XRB OR LOCATION 02254 AND CONSULT
       THE CONSTANT-DELAY TIME TABLE FOR THE TIMING COMPARABLE TO THE VALUE
       IN XRB OR LOCATION 02254. *NOTE* IF SENSE LIGHT 3 IS ON WHEN DETERMINING
       THE TIME BTWEEN ROWS, ADD SIX OCTALLY TO THE VALUE IN XRB OR LOCATION 
       02254 AND CONSTULT THE CONSTANT-DELAY TIME TABLE FOR TIMING BETWEEN ROWS
       SENSE LIGHT 3 IS TURNED ON ONLY IF MAXIMUM TIMING BETWEEN ROWS OCCURS
       BETWEEN 11 ROW RIGHT AN 12 ROW LEFT.

                                                             7/1/58

   3.  IF THERE IS A COMPARISON ERROR AND NO PRINTER ON LINE * SENSE LIGHT
       1 ON-PROGRAM STOP AT LOCATION 06545 * THE VALUE IN XRB OR LOCATION
       02255 SUBTRACTED OCTALLY FROM 455 WILL GIVE THE RECORD THAT FAILED AND
       THE VALUE IN XRA OCTALLY SUBTRACTED FROM 31 WILL GIVE THE WORD THAT
       FAILED. THE ACCUMULATOR WILL CONTAIN THE WORD READ FROM THE CARD AND
       THE MQ WILL CONTAIN THE CORRECT WORD IN STORAGE. XRC CONTAINS THE
       2 S COMPLEMENT OF THE ADDRESS WHERE THE ERROR WAS DETECTED. TO CONTINUE
       PROGRAM, PUSH START.

   4.  TO TEST CARD READER RELIABILITY WITH NORMAL PROGRAMMING DELAY, RUN
       THE TEST WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 AND ALL KEYS UP. WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 DOWN
       AND ALL KEYS UP, THE ADDRESSES OF THE PROGRAM CAUSE A VARIABLE DELAY
       BETWEEN 12 RIGHT AND SELECT CAUSING INTERMITTENT LATCH UP BETWEEN
       RECORDS.

   5.  WHEN DETERMINING TIMING BETWEEN VARIOUS OPERATIONS, ONLY ONE KEY MAY
       BE DEPRESSED AT A TIME.

   6.  THE SPEED OF THE CARD READER IS THE INITIAL TEST OF THE PROGRAM AND IS
       NO UNDER CONTROL OF THE OPERATOR. AFTER THE FIRST PASS, THIS TEST IS
       BYPASSED.

   7.  WHEN TESTING THE TIME BETWEEN 12R AND SELECT,THE CARD READRER 
       SHOULD LATCH UP BEFORE REACHING MAXIMUM TIMING.IF THE CARD
       READER IS SLOW,IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE PROGRAMMED
       DELAY OF 110 MS IN XRA FOR THE TIMING BETWEEN 12R AND 9L FOR
       THE I/O CHECK LIGHT TO BE ON AND THE TEST OPERATE CORRECTLY.
       AND INCREMENT OF 16 OCTAL TO THE ADDRESS OF THE INSTRUCTION
       IN LOCATION 01060 INCREASES THE DELAY BETWEEN 12R AND 9L BY
       ONE MILLISECOND.

   8.  THIS TEST HAS A MODIFICATION PROGRAM WHICH AUTOMATICALLY
       ALTERS THE PROGRAM FOR EACH CHANNEL ON LINE.

   9.  THE ARROW OPPOSITE THE TIMING IN THE CONSTANT-DELAY TIME TABLES
       INDICATES THE TIME MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND ON VARIOUS CARD
       READERS CHECKED.

   10. IF AT ANY TIME IT IS DESIRED TO RELOAD THE PROGRAM UPON ITSELF,
       IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MACHINE BE CLEAR BEFORE PUSHING LOAD
       CARDS BUTTON.
