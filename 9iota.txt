                      SPECIAL FEATURE I/O TRAP DIAGNOSTIC

                                   B.M. 580000

         A. PURPOSE OF TEST

            1. Test all conditions of the I/O Trap feature for the 709 Main Frame
               and Data Synchronizer.

            2. Test added logic and circuitry for the feature.

         B. METHOD OF TEST

            1. The feature is tested through the use of Tape Unit 2 on any or all
               channels.

            NOTE: Only unit 2 is used, and any other units selected in the keys
                  are blocked out.

            2. Any or all of the six channels are tested in order.  (Chan A, Chan B,
               Chan C) etc.

               A test is executed for each of the following conditions:

               a.     00140   All conditions of trap on HTR, HPR, and Manual Status.

            NOTE:     This test will be executed on teh first pass, but will nto be
                      performed again unless a manual transfer is preformed.

               b.     00354   Indicator 18 using all combinations of the other
                              indicators, including indicator 19.

               c.     01057   Floating Point Trap and Store and Trap without being
                              in the I/O Trap Mode.

               d.     01135   The mode is entered and Store and Trap without being
                              in the I/O Trap Mode.

               e.     01256   ENABLE instruction to see that is does not act as LDQ.
                              The operation code for LDQ is 0560 and the opertation
                              code for ENABLE is 0564.

               f.     01306   ENABLE is tested while indexed, indirectly addressed,
                              and index and indirectly address.

                                                                              9IOTA
                                                                              Page 2

               g.     01400   RESTORE is tested to see that it does not trap when
                              the 709 is not enabled for trap.

               h.     01450   Once the Inhibit trigger is turned on, the next RESTORE
                              or ENABLE will not trap until after performing the
                              instruction following the ENABLE or RESTORE.

               i.     01516   Checks that TRA, XEC, LDI, FAD, and PBT work
                              correctly at the trap locations.

               j.     02024   Floating Point Trap takes priority over an I/O trap.

               k.     02150   Load Channel given in time does not trap.

               l.     02177   Test each type of trap individually on each channel.

               m.     02324   No trap occurs after being enabled with zeros.

               n.     02367   One trap inhibits another and that all traps waiting on
                              one channel will be executed after a RESTORE instruction
                              is given.

               o.     02444   ENABLE, after trap is conditioned, will trap immediately
                              and all future traps are inhibited.

               p.     02516   No trap occurs until after executing the instruction
                              following a select.

               q.     02612   TRA on RDNCK and TRA on end of file will act as NOPS
                              if enabled for these conditions also that a select will not
                              reset the command disc. tgr. if enabled for command disc.

               r.     02761   Bring up all trapping conditions on all channels.  Using
                              restore, sequence traps Chan A, Chan. B, Chan. C. etc.

               NOTE:  All channels will be tested individually, before multi
                      channel testing is attempted.

         C. ERROR PRINT ROUTINES

            Three Print Routines are used

            1. The standard 9DEPR is used.

            2. A special error print routine is used to test for correct traps and
               correct data placed in trap locations.

               The symbolic entry to this routine is "SCHCK".  The symbolic entry
               for resetting trap locations is "SREST".

                                                                             9IOTA
                                                                             Page 3


            3. A BCD print subroutine is also used to indicate trapping errors.

               The Symbolic entry to this routine is "SPLAT".

                    location.  Channel A is indicated by the 1.

                 3) Comment at right of first line will indicate what error
                    occurred.  (Nothing stored at LOC 12, stored at LOC 14
                    instead.)

                    Type 1 means Control Word Trap
                    Type 2 means End of File Trap
                    Type 4 means Tape Check Trap

                    Any combination of these may also be shown.

                 3) "TRP LOC ADDR" is the correct contnents of the Instruction
                    Counter when the trap occurred.

                 4) "XEC LOC" is the location which was executed after the trap

              c. Third Line Indicates Error Trap Information

                 This line indicates that at Trap Location 12 nothing was stored

              d. Fouth Line Indicates Error Trap Information

                 This line indicates that the trap information was stored at 14

              \U"B" Print Out\u

                 This print-out indicates a store channel error with the MQ
                 containing the correct result, and the ACC the error.

              \U"C" Print Out\u

                 This printout indicates a comparision error in transmission of
                 data.  "OPN" on the first line will indicate the operation being
                 tested.

              \U"D" Print Out\u

              a. The first line is the same as the "A" print-out with the comment
                 stating that no trap occurred, except that all traps on channel B
                 are enabled, as indicated by 2 in decrement and address.

              b. The second line indicates what should appear in the trap location
                 indicated.

           NOTE:   There are many error Halts throughout program, if instruction
                   counter is not performing correctly.  Commments at Halt locations
                   will indicate errors.
