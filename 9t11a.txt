                 PROGRAM TO READ DIAGNOSTICS FROM DIAGNOSTIC TAPE



A.   PURPOSE OF PROGRAM


     THIS PROGRAM WILL READ AND SEARCH FOR A DIAGNOSTIC FILE WHEN USING THE
     DIAGNOSTIC TAPE .



B.  METHOD OF PROGRAM



    1.  THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN ON TAPE FOLLOWING 9M06A AND 9S01A IN EXAMPLE
        OF SUGGESTED DIAGNOSTIC TAPE.-9T10A. THE 3 PROGRAMS WERE WRITTEN AS
        ONE FILE.

    2.  THE BASIC TEST EXECUTE INITIALLY AND THEN A HALT OCCURS AT LOCATION
        0036 IN 9T11A. THE FILE KEY DESIGNATING FILE ON TAPE IS DEPRESSED.
        PRESS START. WHEN FILE IS FOUND A REWIND OCCURS. WHEN THE LOCATED
        DIAGNOSTIC IS COMPLETE, THE ABOVE OPERATIONS ARE REPEATED TO CALL
        IN NEXT DIAGNOSTICS.

        SEE OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS SECTION 1 OF THIS WRITE UP FOR COMPLETE
        INSTRUCTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS PROGRAM.

                                                            11/1/58
                                                            PAGE 1.002


     00036 - HALT TO ENTER KEY, DESIGNATED FILE TO BE SEATCHED FOR. PUT SWT 6
             DN TO LOOP IN LOCATED DIAGNOSTIC. PRESS START.


E.   ERROR STOPS

     00034 - DID NOT READ OVER TAPE MARK FOLLOWING 9T11A. PRESS START TRY AGAIN.

     00053 - EOF NOT INDICATED WHEN SKIPPING OVER FILES NOT SELECTED. PRESS
             START TO TRY AGAIN.



F.   COMMENTS


     1.  WHEN EXECUTING THE BASIC STORAGE TEST 9S01A AND IT IS DESIRED TO BY-
         PASS STORAGE TEST, RESET AN PRESS LOAD TAPE BUTTON. DO THIS IN BOTH
         HIGH AND LOW TEST.

     2.  WHEN TESTING A TAPE TEST SUCH AS 9T01A ETC. AND YOU ARE READY TO
         LOCATE ANOTHER TEST. FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

         1.  RESET MCHINE PUT SWT 6 UP.

         2.  LOAD TAPE BUTTON

         THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT TAPE PROGRAMS HAVE 9IOM IN THEIR DECKS.
         CONSEQUENTLY THE SWT 6 RTBA 1 SELECT WHEN UP MAY CHANGE TO
         ANOTHER ADDRESS. THIS WOULD START THE TAPE TEST ALL OVER, ELIMINATING
         THE USEFULNESSS OF PUTTING SWT 6 UP TO SELECT DIAGNOSTIC TAPE.

         IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE TAPE TEST WRITE UPS BE READ TO INSURE
         METHODS OF TESTING CHA TAPE 1. THIS IS THE DRIVE WHERE THE DIAGNOSTIC
         TAPE IS IN READY.

         ACTUALLY TO CHANGE THE DIAGNOSTIC TAPE DRIVE TO NO SELECT WOULD BE THE
         EASIEST METHOD. DO THIS WHEN SELECTED TAPE TEST HAS BEEN LOCATED AND
         THE DIAGNOSTIC TAPE IS REWINDING.

                                                            11/1/58

     1.  SET DIAGNOSTIC TAPE ONE CHANNEL A TAPE 1.

     NOTE -- BE SURE FILE PROTECT RING IS REMOVED.

     2.  DEPRESS LOAD TAPE BUTTON.

     3.  THE BASIC TESTS ARE EXECUTE. 9M06, 9S01.

     4.  A HALT AT LOCATION 0036 IN 9T11A OCCURES. PUT CONSOLE KEY DOWN
         CORRESPONDING TO DESIGNATED FILE ON TAPE DESIRED.

         AT THIS POINT LET US USE AN EXAMPLE. LOCATION 9B01A WHICH IS ON
         SUGGESTED FILE IN 9T10. THE INDEX REFERES 9B01A AS FILE KEY 11.

         PUT CONSOLE KEY 11 DN. DEPRESS SWT 6 SO THAT LOCATED DIAGNOSTIC MAY
         LOCK IN TEST. PRESS START.

         WHEN FILE HAS BEEN LOCATED AND IS IN MEMORY. THE DIAGNOSTIC TAPE WILL
         REWIND TO LOAD POINT. WHEN THE DIAGNOSTIC BEING TESTED IS NO LONGER
         NEEDED, PUT SWT 6 UP. THIS WILL SELECT DIAGNOSTIC TAPE. THE BASIC TEST
         WILL EXECUTE AND THE STOP IN 9T11A OCCURS AGAIN TO SELECT NEXT FILE.

         1.  SEE COMMENT SECTION PERTAINING TO SWT 6 SETTING WHEN USING TAPE
             DIAGNOSTICS.

         2.  ONLY ONE FILE AT A TIME MAY BE SEARCHED FOR.

         3.  SEE SUGGESTED SEQUENTIAL FORMAT AS OUTLINED IN 9T10A WRITE UP.
