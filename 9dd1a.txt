                             B. M. 568802 - 766



A.   PURPOSE OF TEST

     1.    Test all Circuitry for the Direct Data Feature

     2.    Test Cable and line connections for Direct Data Simulator

B.   METHOD OF TEST

     1.    The feature which is logically build into Channel B is tested through
           the use of Channel A by Cabling from the summary punch shoe for
           Channel A tape (335021) to the summary punch receptical box
           (566461) and back to Direct Data Summary Punch shoe in the 766
           (319489).

     NOTE:        See page 6 of this write up for the layout of the receptacle
                  box and cables.

     2.    Channel B, D or F may be tested through the use of 9IOM modification
           program.

     3.    The following is a list of tests which will be performed by the
           diagnostic.

C.   ERROR PRINT ROUTINES

     Two Print Routines are Used:

     1.    The standard 9DEPR is used.

                                                            9DD1A
                                                            Page 3


     2.    A special error print routine is used to test for correct traps and
           correct data placed in trap locations.

           The symbolic entrance to this routine is "SPRT".

           A BCD print subroutine is used to print trap errors and comments the
           symbolic entrance to this routine is "SPLAT".

D.   AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

     1.    MF, CF, 1, 2 or 3 DATA Synchronizers and the Special
           Feature summary punch receptacle and cables, as described on
           page 6.

     2.    Storage Locations

           9DDI 00030 - 01756, 02303 - 03415
           9DEPR 06500 - 07663
           9I0M 05500 - 06477

E.   PROGRAM CONTROL

                133 - 134            Blank Cards

     2.    Sense Switch Control

           Switches 1, 2, 3, 4 as per 9DEPR

           Switch = 5 UP         Program will make 1 pass on all Channels
                                 selected, and test switch 6 to repeat or call
                                 in next program.

           Switch = 5 DOWN       Program will loop in Channels initially selected,
                                 without returning to halt to enter control.

           Switch = 6 UP         Call next program

           Switch = 6 DOWN       Will return to halt at beginning of program to
                                 enter keys with new selection.

F.   NORMAL STOPS

     I/O selection is the format used in 9IOM

     NOTE:          See Diagram attached to this write-up on Page 5

I.   COMMENTS

     1.   The Direct Data receptacle must be connected to the system with the
          cables, previously mentioned, before starting program.
         
     2.   Page 7 of this write up contains a diagram of the lines from the Tape
          Channel to the Direct Data Receptacle, and from the Direct Data
          Receptacle to the Tape Channel.
         
          The left side of the diagram labelled Chan. B refers to Direct Data,
          and the right side of the diagram labelled Chan. A refers to the
          Tape Channel.
         
          The Cables should be laid out with each position, as indicated.
         
     3.   Any positions of the Cables which are not used, are floating, but are
          shielded.  The "SPARES" go to edge connectors.
