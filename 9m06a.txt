                 BASIC 709 MAIN FRAME DIAGNOSTIC TEST
                                MANUAL LOAD


A.  UNIT TESTED

    1.  PURPOSE OF TEST   THIS DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM USES A MANUAL LOAD TO
        BOOTSTRAP A MODIFIED VERSION OF 9M01 INTO THE 709 COMPUTER. THE
        MANUAL LOAD IS PERFORMED BY USING A 24 WORD PER CARD DECK AND BY
        MANUALLY SETTING THE CONTROL KEYS ON THE 766 DATA SYNCHRONIZER
        UNIT, THE PROGRAM TESTS ALL MAIN FRAME INSTRUCTIONS EXCEPT THOSE
        PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH INDEXING AND FLOATING POINT. WHEN THE
        TEST DISCOVERS A MACHINE ERROR,IT WILL INTERROGATE THE SENSE
        SWITCHES TO SEE WHETHER AN ERROR IS TO BE INDICATED,A LOOP IS TO
        BE ESTABLISHED,OR A CONTINUATION OF THIS TEST AND/OR A NEW TEST
        IS DESIRED BY THE MACHINE OPERATOR.
        NOTE    THIS IS JUST A TEST FOR 704 INSTRUCTIONS IN THE 709 AND
        DOES NOT INCLUDE 709 INSTRUCTIONS EXCEPT IN THE END OF TEST LINK
    
    2.  METHOD OF TEST   THE FORMAT OF THE DIAGNOSTIC IS ESSENTIALLY
        THE SAME AS 9M01 EXCEPT THAT 9M06 DOES NOT USE THE DIAGNOSTIC
        ENGINEERING SENSE SWITCHES INTERROGATION AND PRINT SUBROUTINE
        9DEPR. IN 9M06 ERROR DETECTION IS PROVIDED WITH A MINIMUM OF
        PROGRAMMING ALTHOUGH STILL UNDER SENSE SWITCH CONTROL AS SHOWN
        IN PART C BELOW.

        I.  SWITCH #6 UP            READ IN NEXT DIAGNOSTIC
        J.  SWITCH #6 DOWN          REPEAT PROGRAM
    
    3.  MANUAL LOAD
    
    A.  INITIALIZE MAIN FRAME BY DEPRESSING THE CLEAR KEY AND PUT
        THE CARD READER IN THE READY STATUS.
    
    B.  SET ONE CHANNEL ON THE DSU TO MANUAL BY PUSHING EITHER THE
        AUTO MAN A BUTTON ON THE CONTROL PANEL OF THE DSU.
    
    C.  PLACE AN OCTAL WORD COUNT OF 4775 IN POSITIONS 3-17 OF THE
        KEYS ON THE DSU CONTROL PANEL AND PLACE THE ADDRESS OF THAT
        LOCATION AT WHICH THE FIRST INSTRUCTION OF THE PROGRAM IS
        DESIRED TO BE PLACED IN POSITIONS 21-35 OF THE SAME KEYS.
    
    D.  DEPRESS THE LOAD CONTROL WORD AND THEN THE LOAD CARDS BUTTONS
        ON THE DSU CONTROL PANEL. THE MANUAL LOAD PROCEDURE IS
        THEN COMPLETE AND CARDS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY START BEING
        READ. AT THE END OF THE TEST THE AUTO MANU BUTTON SHOULD
        AGAIN BE DEPRESSED TO RESTORE THE DSU TO AUTOMATIC CONTROL
        FROM THE COMPUTER.
    
D.  NORMAL STOPS

Q       4510                    DVH WITH HALT WHEN SENSE
        4524                    SWITCH FVE IS DOWN.
        4553                    PUSH START TO CONTINUE,WILL NOT HALT
                                ON NEXT PASS.

E.  ERROR STOPS

    CONSULT PROGRAM LISTING AT LOCATION INDICATED BY INSTRUCTION COUNTER
    FOR INSTRUCTION THAT FAILED. PUSHING THE START BUTTON WILL CAUSE THE
    PROGRAM TO CONTINUE.

F.  PRINT OUTS

    NONE

G.  COMMENTS
        THIS DIAGNOSTIC IS TO BE USED WHEN 9M01 WILL NOT LOAD WITH
        EITHER OF ITS LOADERS,OR WHEN A TIGHTER LOOP IS DESIRED FOR
        SCOPING A MAIN FRAME INSTRUCTION EXCEPT FOR THOSE ASSOCIATED
        WITH INDEXING,FLOATING POINT,OR UNIQUELY WITH THE 709. THERE IS
        A RESTART IN THE PROGRAM WHICH IS RESET AFTER THE TRAPPING
        ROTUINES. RESTART IS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TEST. AFTER THE 9M06
        HAS BEEN RUN,RESTORE THE DSU TO AUTOMATIC BY AGAIN DEPRESSING
        THE AUTO MAN BUTTON ON THE CONTROL PANEL OF THE DSU THAT WAS
        DEPRESSED IN INITIALLY LOADING 9M06.
