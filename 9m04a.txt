           709 INDIRECT ADDRESSING DIAGNOSTIC AND RELIABILITY TEST

A- UNIT TESTED

   1.  PURPOSE OF TEST
      
       THE PURPOSE OF THIS DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM IS TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST
       OF THE EXECUTION OF 709 INSTRUCTIONS WHICH ARE BOTH VALIDLY AND
       INVALIDLY INDIRECTLY ADDRESSABLE IN AND OUT OF TRAPPING MODE, AND IN
       CONJUNCTION WITH INDEXING. THE DIAGNOSTIC PRINTER BOARD SHOULD BE USED
       WITH THIS TEST.
      
   2.  METHOD OF TEST
      
       THE PROGRAM IS DIVIDED INTO A VARIETY OF PARTS CONSISTING OF A CURSORY
       TEST OF DIRECT ADDRESSING, AND INDIRECT ADDRESSING TEST WITH REFERENCE
       TO STORAGE, WITH WORD TRANSMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, WITH LOGIC
       INSTRUCTIONS, WITH INDEXABLE TRANFER INSTRUCTIONS, WITH INDEXABLE
       TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TRAPPING MODE, WITH SENSE INDICATOR
       TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS, WITH INDEXABLE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS INDEXED,
       AND WITH NON-INDEXABLE TRANFER INSTRUCTIONS. THE CURSORY TEST OF DIRECT
       ADDRESSING TESTS THE CLA INSTRUCTION WITH NO BITS IN POSITION 12 AND
       13, WITH A BIT IN POSITION 12, AND WITH A BIT IN POSITION 13. IN EACH
       OF THESE CASES THE CLA SHOULD NOT INDIRECT ADDRESS. IN THE CASE WHERE
       A CONDITINAL TRANFER INSTRUCTION REFERS TO A BUFFER CONDITION THE
       ONLY CASE THAT IS TESTED IS THE ONE WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE BUFFER
       TO BE IN OPERATION. WHEN NON-INDEXABLE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TESTED WITH
       INDIRECT ADDRESSING, THE CORRECT OPERATION IS TO IGNORE THE INDIRECT
       ADDRESSING AN TO DIRECT ADDRESS INSTEAD. THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE
       TESTED AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE TESTED AER GIVEN UNDER THE
       COMMENTS SECTION OF THIS WRITE UP. THE DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING SENSE
       SWITCH INTERROGATION AND PRINT ROUTINE -9DEPR- CONTROLS THE RUNNING OF
       THE PROGRAM. 9DEPR IS REFERRED TO BY EVERY INDIVIDUAL TEST AND IT
       CONTAINS ESSENTIALLY TWO CONDITIONS.
           A. ON NO ERROR          THE SUBROUTINE 9DEPR WILL EXAMINE
                                   SW1. IF SW1 IS DOWN, THE PROGRAM WILL
                                   REPEAT THE TEST. IS SW1 IS UP, THE
                                   SUBROUTINE WILL EXAMINE SW4, IF SW4 IS
                                   DOWN, THE PROGRAM WILL REPEAT THE TEST
                                   50 TIMES BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE NEXT
                                   TEST, IF SW4 IS UP, THE PROGRAM GOES
                                   DIRECTLY TO THE NEXT TEST.
           B. ON AN ERROR          THE SUBROUTINE 9DEPR WILL EXAMINE SW2.
                                   IF SW2 IS DOWN, THE PROGRAM WILL BYPASS ALL
                                   ERROR INDICATIONS AND EXAMINE SW1. IF SW2
                                   IS UP, THE PROGRAM WILL EXAMINE SW3. IF SW3
                                   IS DOWN, THE MACHINE WILL HALT AND DISPLAY
                                   ERROR INDICATIONS ON THE OERATORS CONSOLE.
                                   IF SW3 IS UP THE MACHINE WILL PRINT OUT

                                                          7-01-58

                                   ERROR INDICATIONS. REGARDLESS OF THE SETTING
                                   OF SW2 AND SW3, THE PROGRAM WILL EVENTUALLY
                                   RETURN TO EXAMINE SW1 IN THE SAME MANNER
                                   AS IN THE NO ERROR CASE EXCEPT IN THE CASE
                                   WHEN SW4 IS DOWN. IN THIS CASE THE PROGRAM
                                   WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE NEXT TEST ROUTINE
                                   WITHOUT LOOPING 50 TIMES.
       FOR ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION OF 9DEPR CONSULT THE LISTING AND WRITE UP
       SUBMITTED WITH THIS SUBROUTINE.
       
       THE PHILOSOPHY USED IN THIS TEST IS TO ASSUME THAT IF AN ERROR
       OCCURS IN A GIVEN SECTION. IT IS LIMITED TO THE INSTRUCTION TESTED IN
       THAT PARTICULAR SECTION SINCE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS USED IN THE TEST
       HAVE BEEN TESTED IN DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS 9M01,9M02, AND 9M03. THE
       RELIABILITY PORTION OF THE TEST IS UNDER CONTROL OF THE SENSE SWITCHES
       1,4, AND 6. IF ONE OF THESE SWITCHES IS DOWN,THE PROGRAM WILL REPEAT A
       PART OF THE PROGRAM. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS REPETITION WILL FORCE
       COMPONENTS ON THE BORDER LINE OF OPERATION OR COMPNENTS OPERATING
       INTERMITTANTLY TO FAIL DURRING THE DIAGNOSTIC RUN RATHER THEN DURING 
       CUSTOMER TIME.

       THE SECTION OF THE ROUTINE IN ERROR.
     
       THE PROGRAM CONTAINS ONE POST RESTART. A POST RESTART IS THE ACT OF
       STORING A TRANSFER INSTRUCTION AT LOCATION ZERO SO THAT THE DEPRESSION
       OF THE START KEY WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO TRANSFER TO THE ADDRESS
       SPECIFIED BY ZERO WHEN THE INSTRUCTION COUNTER IS RESET. THIS ADDRESS
       IS TO THE FIRST SECTION OF THE 9M04 INDEXING TEST.
