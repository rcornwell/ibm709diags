                            FOR A 738 CORE STORAGE


A.  PURPOSE
        
    THIS TEST IS TO BE USED WITH A 738 CORE STORAGE. ONE HALF OF THE TEST LOADS
    THE PROGRAM INTO THE FIRST 2000 LOCATIONS IN STORAGE AND TESTS THE REST OF
    STORAGE. THE SECOND HALF OF THE TEST LOADS THE PROGRAM INTO THE LAST 2000
    LOCATIONS IN STORAGE AND TESTS THE FIRST 76000 LOCATIONS OF STORAGE.

    THIS PROGRAM GIVES A COMPLEMENT CHECKERBOARD TEST, THEN AN ALL ZEROS TEST,
    AND THE AN ALL ONES TEST.

    THE COMPLEMENT CHECKERBOARD TESTS STORAGE BY PUTTING THE PATTERN BELOW
    PHYSICALLY IN STORAGE.

                                 00 11 00 11
                                 00 11 00 11
                                 11 00 11 00
                                 11 00 11 00
                                 00 11 00 11

    AS THE ACTUAL PROGRAM LOCATIONS DIFFER FROM THE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS, A
    MEMORY PRINTOUT WILL SHOW EVERY TWO ADDRESSES ALTERNATING IN EACH SECTION
    CONSISTING OF 2000 ADDRESSES. AT THE END OF EACH SECTION THE PATTERN WILL
    REVERSE FOR THE NEXT SECTION UNTIL A BLOCK -MADE UP OF FOUR SECTIONS- IS
    FILLED. EACH TIME A BLOCK OF ADDRESSES -10,000 ADDRESSES- IF FILLED TH
    PATTERN IS NOT REVERSED WHEN ENTERING INTO THE NEXT BLOCK. EIGHT BLOCS
    MAKE UP THE TOTAL STORAGE. THIS TEST IS TO CAUSE A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF NOISE
    TO APPEAR ON THE SENSE WINDINGS.

    THE ALL ZEROS PART OF THE PROGRAM FILLS MEMORY WITH ZEROS AND THE CHECKS
    TO SEE IF EACH LOCATIONS CONTAINS ZERO.

    THE ALL ONES PART OF THE PROGRAM FILLS MEMORY WITH ONES AND THE CHECKS TO
    SEE IF EACH LOCATION CONTAINS ONES.

    THE 3 ROUTINES ARE FLEXIBLE SO THAT DIFFERENT PATTERNS CAN BE CHECKED IN
    MEMORY. BY CHANGING SYMBOLIC LOCATIONS TEST 1, TEST 2, ZEROS, ZEROS+1, ONES
    AND ONES+1, A VARIETY OF PATTERNS CAN BE TESTED. IF A WORST PATTERN IS
    FOUND PLEASE NOTIFY THE DPM DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING GROUP AS TO THE TYPE OF
    PATTERN THAT WAS USED.

E.  EXAMPLE OF PRINTOUT

    EXAMPLE 1

ERROR ADDRESS 74555 ERROR WORD 000 010 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
INITIAL     PATTERN  TEST WORD 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
LOCATION OF SWITCH CORES- Y3 MATRIX ROW 3, COL 1- X2 MATRIX ROW 6, COL 3

    EXAMPLE 2

ERROR ADDRESS 34555  ERROR WORD 111 111 101 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 11
COMPLEMENT PATTERN    TEST WORD 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 11
LOCATION OF SWITCH CORES- Y1 MATRIX ROW 6, COL 1- X2 MATRIX ROW 6, COL 3

    THE PRINTOUT IS SELF EXPLANATORY. THE FIRST LINE CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF
    THE WORD THAT FAILED AND THE WORD AT THAT LOCATION.

    THE SECOND LINE CONTAINS THE TYPE OF ERROR, INITIAL OR COMPLEMENT, AND THE
    CORRECT WORD.

    THE THIRD LINE CONTAINS THE LOCATION OF THE SWITCH CORES THAT SELECT THE

    ADDRESS IN ERROR.

    IN EXAMPLE 1 THE WORD AT ADDRESS 74555 PICKED UP A BIT IN POSITION 4 ON THE
    INITIAL TEST. THIS ADDRESS IS SELECTED BY THE Y3 AND X2 SWITCH CORE
    MATRIX. THE 2 SWITCH CORES ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED AT -1.- THE 3RD ROW
    AND THE 1ST COLUMN OF THE Y3 MATRIX, AND -2- THE 6TH ROW AND THE 3RD COLUMN
    OF THE X2 MATRIX.

                                                              7-01-58

F.  COMMENTS

    1.  THE PROGRAM TAKES ABOUT ONE MINUTE TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL PASS THROUGH
        EACH HALF OF THE PROGRAM.

    2.  EACH HALF OF THE PROGRAM IS ALMOST IDENTICAL IN OPERATION EXCEPT THAT
        THE FIRST HALF OF THE PROGRAM WILL TEST THE HIGH END OF MEMORY AND THE
        SECOND HALF TESTS THE LOW END OF MEMORY.

    3.  THE PROGRAM WRITES A COMPLEMENT PATTERN, CHECKS A WORD, WRITES ANOTHER
        WORD IN ITS PLACE, CHECKS THIS WORD, AND THEN RESTORES THE INITIAL
        WORD. IT DOES THIS TO EACH ADDRESS IN SEQUENCE. AFTER ONE COMPLETE
        PATTERN IS READ, THE ROUTINE THEN WRITES AND CHECKS AN INVERSE PATTERN.

    4.  THE PROGRAM AS DESCRIBED ABOVE GOES THROUGH THIS ROUTINE THREE TIMES
        IN HAKING A COMPLETE PASS. THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THE ROUTINE THE TEST
        WORDS USED ARE -1- -ZERO AND -2- -377777777777. THE SECOND TIME
        THROUGH THE TEST WORDS ARE BOTH ZERO. THE THIRD TIME THROUGH THE TEST
        WORDS ARE BOTH -377777777777.

    5.  THE TWO TEST WORDS T1 AND T2 WILL ALTERNATE THROUGH THE NORMAL OPERATION
        OF THE TEST. THE PROGRAM WILL RUN CORRECTLY FOR ANY TEST WORDS.
    
    6.  THE BASIC TEST WORDS CAN BE CHANGED TO GIVE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
        PATTERNS. THEY ARE LOCATED AT 1244 AND 1245, AND 77343 AND 77344.
    
    7.  THE PROGRAM MAY FAIL BECAUSE OF AN ALTERATION IN THE PROGRAM ITSELF DUE
        TO A STORAGE FAILURE.

    8.  BY PUTTING SENSE SWITCH 1 DOWN WHEN SENSE LIGHTS 2 AND 3 ARE OFF, THE
        PROGRAM WILL LOOP IN THE COMPLEMENT CHECKERBOARD ROUTINE.

    WHEN LIGHT 2 IS ON IT WILL LOOP INTO THE ALL ZEROS ROUTINE.
    WHEN LIGHT 3 IS ON IT WILL LOOP INTO THE ALL ONES ROUTINE.

    9.  THE FIRST HALF OF THE PROGRAM WILL LOAD INTO MEMORY AND TEST THE
        MACHINE. WHEN SENSE SWITCH 6 IS UP THE SECOND HALF WILL LOAD INTO MEMORY
        AND TEST THE MACHINE.
