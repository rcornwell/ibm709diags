                   TEST FOR WALKING SWITCH
                   CORES IN 738 CORE ON 709

A. PURPOSE

   This test is to be used on a 709 system with 738 core storage, It attempts to
   aggravate 5998's which continue to have small plate currents when the grid
   input is down. This small plate current may "walk" a half select switch core.

B. AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED
   1. Units Card Reader
          Main Frame with 738

   2. Storage Locations
          Program 00000 to 00027
	  Test area 00030 to 77777

C. PROGRAM CONTROL
   1. Deck - one card 9S10A00
	       Self loading
   2. No Sense Switches
   3. No Sense Lite

D. ERROR STOPS
   00007 - Core position about to be tested is not clear. Switch Core "walked"!
   Address is in accumulator

   00016 - Core position just tested can not now be cleared. Possible bad switch
   core. Address is in accumulator.

E. PRINT-OUTS
   None

F. COMMENTS
   The STORE and subsequent EXECUTE of the CAQ with the decrement indicated
   causes 76 consecutive "E" cycles to the same address. This will half select other
   switch cores 76 times and unstable 5998's may then "walk" a switch core.
   It is possible to marginal test the -220V MSD-DPD bias at -216V#l to aggravate
   the 5998's. This control is located below the MSD Reference Voltage Adjust in
   CSF-1. The MSD-DPD bias may be lowered to -222V as the spec states it to be
   -220V+/-2V. This procedure increases the reliability of the 5998 tube bias.
