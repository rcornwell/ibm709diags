                        729 UNIT TEST

A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

     1.  TO CHECK TAPE INFORMATION FLOW AND CHECK EXECUTION OF I/O
         INSTRUCTIONS IN REFERENCE TO TAPE.

B.  METHOD OF TEST

     1.  THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF TWO BASIC SECTIONS. THE FIRST
         USES A FIXED PATTERN AND IS ESSENTIALLY DIAGNOSTICS. IT
         INCLUDES ALL ROUTINES UP TO B19. THIS FIXED PATTERN CONSISTS
         OF 100 DIFFERENT WORDS IN ASCENDING NUMERICAL VALUE STARTING
         WITH 010101010101. SEE CONSTANT AREA STARTING WITH FIX IN
         LISTING. AN ERROR INDICATION WILL SHOW THE RELATIVE WORD
         POSITION IN THE RECORD OR FILE BY THE NUMBER IN THE WORD. IN
         AREAS USING MORE THEN 100 WORDS, THE PATTERN ISREPEATED. THE
         SECOND SECTION START AT B19 USES A RANDOM FORMED PATTERN TO
         WRITE A RANDOM NUMBER OF RECORDS OF RANDOM LENGTH ANDIS
         ESSENTIALLY A RELIABILITY TEST. THE PROGRAM BUILDS FROM
         SIMPLER ROUTINES CHECKING TAPE POSITION AND MOTION AND DS
         INDICATIONS, TO CHECKING FULL INFORMATION FLOW. EACH ROUTINE
         ATTEMPTS TO ISOLATE A SINGLE CONDITION OF FAILURE AS DESCRIBED
         BY ROUTINE HEADINGS AND COMMENTS.
         IT ASSUMES THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF ALL PRECEEDING
         ROUTINES IN 9T01 AND MAIN FRAME PROGRAMS.

     2.  THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN FOR CHANNEL A, TAPE FRAME 1
         AND USES MODIFICATION ROUTINE 9IOM TO ALTER THE PROGRAM
         TO TEST REQUIRED FRAMES AND CHANNELS SPECIFIED BY CONTROL
         WORDS ENTERED AT BEGINNING OF TEST. SEE E NORMAL STOPS.

     3.  THIS PROGRAM USES THE STANDARD 709 ERROR PRINT ROUTINE 9DEPR
         FOR ERROR INDICATION AND PROGRAM CONTROL.

C.  AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

     1.  UNITS   MF, CF, CR, PR, DS AND TAPE UNITS TO BE TESTED.

     2.  STORAGE LOCATION    00000 TO 04713  9T101 DIAGNOSTIC

     2.  SENSE SWITCH CONTROL

         SENSE SWITCHES 1, 2, 3 AND 4 ARE USED BY 9DEPR. SEE
         WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEIR USE
         WHICH IS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS

        A. SWITCH 1 UP - TEST SENSE SWITCH 4

           SWITCH 1 DN - REPEAT TEST LOOP

        B. SWITCH 2 UP - INDICATE ERROR - TEST SSW 3 TO
                         PRINT OR HALT
           SWITCH 2 DN - BYPASS ERROR INDICATION - TEST SSW 1

        C. SWITCH 3 UP - PRINT OUT IF SSW 2 UP THE TEST SSW 1

           SWITCH 3 DN - STOP ON ERROR IF SSW 2 IS UP. THEN
                         TEST SSW 1

        D. SWITCH 4 UP - PROCEED TO NEXT TEST ROUTINE

           SWITCH 4 DN - REPEAT SECTION N TIMES. OR IF ERROR
                         OCCURS GO TO NEXT SECTION

        E. SWITCH 5    - NOT USED

        F. SWITCH 6 UP - END TEST - CALL IN NEXT PROGRAM

           SWITCH 6 DN - REPEAT ENTIRE PROGRAM

         CONTROL WORDS FOR CHANNELS AND UNITS USED IN
         MODIFICATION ROUTINE 9IOM. ON. TWO OR THREE STOPS
         WILL OCCUR CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF DS TO BE TESTED
         AS SPECIFIED BY THE TAG BITS OF FIRST CONTROL WORD.

              A TAG OF 1 SPECIFIES CHN A AND/OR B
              A TAG OF 2 SPECIFIES CHN C AND/OR D
              A TAG OF 4 SPECIFIES CHN E AND/OR F

         IF MORE THEN ONE DS IS TO BE TESTED, THEN THE FIRST
         CONTROL WORD SHOULD CONTAIN A MULTIPLE TAG.

         05517   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR FIRST DS ON KEYS
                 TAG FOR ALL DS TO BE TESTED
                 PRESS START

         05533   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHN C AND/OR D
                 PRESS START

         05540   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHN E AND/OR F
                 PRESS START

         05525   CONTROL WORD FAILED TO CONTAIN A TAG FOR ANY
                 DS. RE-ENTER FIRST CONTROL WORD WITH TAG
                 PRESS START

         SEE CONTROL WORD FORMAT

F.  ERROR STOPS

     1.  9DEPR ERROR INDICATION STOPS WITH SSW 3 DOWN

         06517   INDEX REGISTER C CONTAINS THE TWOS COMPLEMENT
                 OF THE ERROR EXIT ADDRESS. READ LIGHTS THAT ARE
                 OUT + 1 AND CONSULT THAT ADDRESS IN PROGRAM
                 LISTING FOR ERROR ANALYSIS.

         06545   SAME AS ABOVE
                 PUSH START TO CONTINUE PROGRAM

     2.  PROGRAM STOPS

         00135   HANG UP IN THIS AREA INDICATES FAILURE TO
                 DISCONNECT FROM A SELECT WITH A DISCONNECT
         00151   CONTROL WORD FOLLOWING A NON-DATA INSTRUCTION.

         00212   HANG UP IF CHANNEL FAILS TO DISCONNECT

G.  ERROR PRINT OUTS

         SEE WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR EXAMPLE AND DESCRIPTION
         OF PRINT OUT.

         TEST LOC IS ADDRESS OF ENTRY TO ROUTINE IN WHICH
         ERROR OCCURRED. OPN IS THE INSTRUCTION MOST BASIC
         TO THE CONDITION BEING TESTED IN FAILING ROUTINE.
         ERROR ADR IS THE EXIT FROM THE FAILING ROUTINE TO
         9DEPR.

H.  COMMENTS

     1.  A POST RESTART IS INCLUDED WHICH STORES AT LOCATION
         ZERO A TRANSFER TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FRAME TEST.
         ANY TIME THE CONSOLE IS RESET, PRESSING START WILL
         TRANSFER THE PROGRAM TO BEGIN TESTING THE CURRENT
         FRAME.

     2.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE ERROR PRINT
         OUT IS THE ERROR ADR. BY REFERRING TO THIS ADDRESS
         IN THE PROGRAM LISTING, THE ROUTINE WHICH FAILED MAY BE
         LOCATED. BY ANALYZING THE ROUTINE WITH THE AID OF THE
         PROGRAM COMMENTS. IT IS HOPED THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER
         WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MACHINE
         FAILED AND SO HAVE SUFFICIENT INFOMRATION TO DIAGNOSE
         THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION.

     3.  READ-WRITE IN BCD MODE ROUTINE STARTING AT BCD USES THE SET
         OF INSTRUCTION FROM FRM TO RTB7 AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED
         TO BCD MODE AT END OF ROUTINE THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE RESTORED
         TO BINARY MODE.
         SEE 21, 22 AND 23 UNDER J.
