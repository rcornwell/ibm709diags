    00021 OR 77523                  ERROR IN STORAGE DEFLECTION
    00065 OR 77567                  ERROR IN ONES AND ZEROS
    00205 OR 77707                  ERROR IN RANDOM NUMBERS

    NOTE-STOP AT ANY OTHER LOCATION IN DEFLECTION SECTION MAY INDICATE
        INSTRUCTION COUNTER FAILURE.

F.  PRINT OUT

    A.  STORAGE DEFLECTION - NONE
    B.  ONES AND ZEROS-ONE LINE WILL BE PRINTED. THE ERROR AND ERROR ADDRESS
        ARE PRINTED IN BINARY. THE POSITION IN ERROR IS DETERMINED BY THE
        INCONSISTENT BIT. THE FIRST POSITION IN THE ERROR WORD IS THE SIGN.

        THE EXAMPLE BELOW SHOWS THAT POSITION 14 FAILED TO READ OR WRITE A ONE
        AT ADDRESS 03674.
        000011110111100          111 111 111 111 110 111 111 111 111 111 111 111

    C.  RANDOM NUMBERS-TWO LINES WILL PRINT IN THE SAME FORM AS BEFORE EXCEPT
        THAT TWO LINES WILL PRINT, GIVING THE ERROR ADDRESS AND ERROR WORD ON
        FIRST LINE AND CORRECT WORD ON THE SECOND LINE.

G.  COMMENTS

    1.  SENSE LIGHTS INDICATE WHAT TEST ROUTINE IS BEING PERFORMED.
        SENSE LIGHT #1 SIGNIFIES WORKING IN STORAGE DEFLECTION
                    #2 SIGNIFIES WORKING IN ONES AND ZEROS

        NOTE-LIGHT  #4 IS USED BY THIS SECTION IN NORMAL RUNNING

                    #3 SIGNIFIES WORKING IN RANDOM NUMBERS

    2.  IN THE DEFLECTION SECTION OF THE TEST, IF AN ERROR HALT OCCURS AND THE
        ERROR WORD WHICH APPEARS IN THE MQ SHOWS THE ERROR IN THE ADDRESS
        PORTION, THE CORRECT ADDRESS WILL NOT BE SHOWN AS STATED ON THE LISTING,
        HOWEVER, THE CORRECT ADDRESS WILL APPEAR IN THE ACCUMULATOR.

    3.  IN THE ONES & ZEROS SECTION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INDEFINATELY REPEAT
        ONES OR ZEROS RATHER THAN ALTERNATING, THROUGH THE USE OF SENSE SWITCHES
        #4 AND #5. SEE SENSE SWITCH CONTROL

    4.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENTER ANY OF THE THREE PHASES OF THE TEST BY
        TRANSFERRING MANUALLY.
        A.  STORAGE DEFLECTION      9S01 HA - TRA 00000
                                    9S01 LA - TRA 77501
        B.  ONES AND ZEROS          9S01 HA - TRA 00040
                                    9S01 LA - TRA 77542
        C.  RANDOM NUMBERS          9S01 HA - TRA 00126
                                    9S01 LA - TRA 77630

    5.  THE PROGRAM AT A LEVEL CONSISTS OF 8 PAGES.

    6.  THE TIME FOR ONE PASS THROUGH ALL THREE SECTIONS OF EITHER 9S01 HA OR LA
        IS APPROXIMATELY 6 SEC.

    7.  THE PROGRAM OF COURSE DOES NOT HAVE A RESTART. AFTER THE FIRST RUN THE
        TEST FOR SIZE OF STORAGE WILL BE WRITTEN OVER, THEREFORE, IF IT IS
        DESIRABLE TO RESTART, A MANUAL TRANSFER WILL BE NECESSITATED, TO THE
        ABOVE MENTIONED LOCATIONS.

        NOTE.  PASS COMPLETE WILL NOT BE PRINTED, AS THIS CANNOT BE WIPED OUT
               BY THE PROGRAM, AND WILL THEREFORE ADD TO THE LOCATIONS USE
               TO STORE THE PROGRAM.
