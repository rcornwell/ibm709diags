                   RELIABILITY TEST FOR COMPLETE
                             709 SYSTEM

A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

    1.  TO TEST EVERY I/O UNIT CONNECTED WITH A 709 SYSTEM AS WELL AS EVERY
        MAIN FRAME INSTRUCTION IN RELIABILITY FASHION. THIS TEST IS NOT A
        ROUND ROBIN, BUT A MF-I/O INTERLOCK TEST. 

B.  METHOD OF TEST

    1.  THE KEYS ARE USED TO SELECT THE DESIRED I/O UNITS TO BE TESTED. USING
        THE STANDARD KEY SELECTION FORMAT USED IN ALL PREVIOUS I/O DIAGNOSTICS

        A DIAGRAM OF I/O UNIT SELECTION IS INCLUDED IN THE WRITE UP.

    2.  THE PROGRAM WILL USE ALL CHANNELS INDICATED IN THE KEYS AT ALL TIMES.

    3.  THERE ARE 19 SECTIONS TO THE TEST. EACH SECTION WILL PRINT--SECTION
        X COMPLETE---. SECTIN COMPLETE WILL BE PRINTED EVEN IF THE I/O UNITS
        AFFECTED IN THE PARTICULAR SECTION WERE NOT SELECTED BY THE OPERATOR.
        THIS WILL SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROGRESSING CORRECTLY THROUGH ITS
        SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

    4.  THE VARIOUS SECTIONS ARE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL, IN SECTION C.

    5.  EACH SECTION OVERLAPS THE NEXT SO THAT THERE IS NO LOGICAL BREAKING
        POINT IN THE PROGRAM. I/O IS ALWAYS MOVING DURING MF OPERATION.

    6.  BEFORE THE COPMARISON FOR A PERVIOUS READ INSTRUCTION. THE NEXT
        I/O UNITS WILL BE SELECTED. I/O UNITS ARE ALWAYS IN TRANSMISSION
        STATUS WHEN MAIN FRAME IS OPERATING.

    7.  THE TIME OF THE PROGRAM IS APPROXIMATELY 140 SECONDS ON THE FIRST
        PASS, AND 20 SECONDS ON EACH SUCCEEDING PASS.-ASSUMING 16 DRUMS
        ARE SELECTED. DRUMS AND CRT WILL BY TESTED ONLY ONCE,M UNLESS
        SWITCH + IS DOWN DURING THE 1ST HALF OF THE TEST. AND 2ND HALF
        OF THE DECK WILL RUN 20 SECONDS PER PASS THROUGH THE PROGRAM.
        HOWERVER, PASS COMPLETE WILL NOT BE PRINTED UNTIL ALL UNITS ARE
        TESTED.

    8.  THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE THE NUMBER OF PASSES EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER
        OF TAPE UNITS SELECTED ON ANY ONE CHANNEL. BEFORE PRINTING PASS
        COMPLETE AND TESTING SWITHC SIX.

    9.  THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE PRINTING-PASS COMPLETE 9SY1-.
        SHOULD BE NO MORE THEN 5 MIN WHICH WOULD EQUAL -- 16 DRUMS, CRT,
        ANY NUMBER OF CARD MACHINES, UP TO 9, AND ANY NUMBER OF TAPE 
        DRIVES, UP TO 48.



                                                                   9SY1A
                                                                   3-1-59
                                                                   PAGE 1.002


        THE NUMBER OF PASSES. BEFORE TESTING SWITCH SIX, IS DETERMINED
        BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TAPE UNITS ON ANY ONE CHANNEL. IT CAN BE
        PLAINLY SEEN THAT THE TESTING OF DRUMS AND CRT ARE WHAT TAKE THE
        GREATEST AMOUNT OF TIME. THESE WILL BE EXCLUDED AFTER THE SECOND HALF
        OF THE DECK IS READ IN.

   10.  THE PROGRAM IS READ INTO STORAGE IN 2 LOADS. THE FIRST LOAD WILL
        TEST DRUM, CRT, DS AND TCU CONTROL AND DATA CIRCUITS-EACH CHANNEL
        INDIVIDUALLY-, AND DRUM AND I/O INTERLOCK. IF SWITCH 6 IS UP, THE
        SECOND HALF WILL THEN BE READ OVER THE FIRST HALF, FROM 00152-
        05531. THE CONSTANT AREA AND SUBROUTINE AREA 05531-10614 AND
        71316-77775, OR 11316-77779, WILL ALWAYS BE READ WITH THE FIRST
        HALF AND REMAIN AT THE ABOVE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM.

C.  DESCRIPTION OF SECTIONS
 
    1.  SECTION 1

        THIS SECTION WILL EXAME THE DSC TO MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT RESET
        BECAUSE OF PRESSING START. THIS WILL BE TESTED AFTER PRESSING
        START TO ENTER CONTROL WORDS.

    2.  SECTION II
   
        TESTS EACH DSC AND TCU, CONTROL AND DATA LINES. ONE DSC AND TCU
        AT A TIME ARE TESTED TO INSURE THE PROGRAM THAT EACH WILL OPERATE
        INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHER.

    3.  SECTION III
 
        ONE LINE OF WRITE PRINTER, AND ONE LINE OF READ PRINTER IS PRINTED,
        AND ONE CARD IS PUNCHED. THIS IS DONE ON DSC A, THEN DSC C, THEN
        DSC E, IF ALL HAVE BEEN SELECTED.

    4.  SECTION IV

        TESTS ANY NUMBER OF DRUMS UP TO 16. DRUMS ARE TESTED SEQUENCTIALLY AS
        GIVEN. EACH DRUM IS GIVEN A SHORT LDA TEST. A SWITCHING TEST,
        A RANDOM NUMBER TEST, AND THE ADDED 709 DRUM USAGE -- LDA INDEXED,
        LDA INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED, LDA INDEXED AND INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED, AND
        HANG UP ON COPY.

    5.  SECTION V

H.  STANDARD SUB ROUTINES

        THE STANDARD 9DEPR WAS ASSEMBLED WITH 9SY1 AND APPEARS IN THE
        LISTING. THIS HAD TO BE DONE BECUASE OF THE SIZE OF 9SY1. THE I/O
        MODIFICATION PROGRAM USED WAS ASSEMBLED WITH 9SY1 ALSO, FOR THE
        SAME REASON, HOWEVER, THE MODIFICATION ROUTINE HAS BEEN REWITTEN TO
        FIT THE NEED OF 9SY1. THIS CHANGE DOES NOT EFFECT THE MAIN
        PROGRAM.
   
        I/O SELECTION.

   1.   THE VERSION OF THE I/O MODIFICATION USED IN 9SY1 DOES NOT MODIFY
        ANY INSTRUCTION. EXCEPT TAPE SELECTS.
    
        IF ONE CHANNEL HAS MORE TAPE UNITS THEN ANOTHER, AS SELECTED IN THE
        KEYS, THE I/O MODIFICATION PROGRAM WILL RETURN THE UNIT SELECT TO 1


                                                                   9SY1A

        ON THE CHANNEL HAVING THE SMALLER NUMBER OF UNITS SELECTED. PROGRMA
        WILL CONTINUE FROM THERE UNTIL THE NUMBER OF PASSES HAVE BEEN MADE
        CORRESPONDING TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNITS ON ANY ONE CHANNEL.

EXAMPLE
    
        ASSUME THE ENTRY INTO THE KEYS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

            CHANNEL A --- 2 UNITS   CHANNEL B --- 4 UNITS
            CHANNEL C --- 6 UNITS   CHANNEL D --- 1 UNIT

        CHANNELS                    UNIT+ ON PASS

            D                       1 1 1 1 1 1 

        WHEN THE HIGHEST UNIT COUNT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 0, THE PROGRAM
        WILL BE RESET TO ITS INITIAL STATE. AND WILL PRINT-PASS COMPLETE
         9 SY1-THEN TEST SWITCHES 5 AND 6.

I.  COMMENTS

    1.  CARE MUST BE EXERCISED IN A MANUAL TRANSFER TO A GIVEN SECTION FO THE
        PROGRAM.

        FLOATING POINT SECTIONS HAVBE BEEN MONITORED AS PER 9M05, AND A
        MANUAL TRANSFER MUST BE GIVEN ONLY TO THE BEGINNING OF A FLOATING
        POINT SECTION. SECTIONS 13 AND 14.

        THE SECTION COMPLETE PRINT OUTS WILL INDICATE THE OCTAL ADDRESS
         TO TRANSFER TO, IF A MANUAL TRANSFER IS TO BE MADE.

    2.  IF THE S KEY IS NOT THROWN DOWN AT THE FIRST I/O MODIFICATION HALT, THE
        PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE THE CARD READER SELECT TO A TAPE
        SELECT AT THE TWO AREAS IN THE PROGRAM WHERE SWITCH 6 IS TESTED. S KEY
        UP INDICATES THAT THE PROGRAM IS BEING READ FROM TAPE. IF THE PROGRAM
        SUBSEQUENTLY COMES BACK TO I/O MODIFICATION PROGRAM, S KEY NEED NOT
        BE TOUCHED, UNLESS THE PROGRAM HAS AGAIN BEEN READ INTO STORAGE.

    3.  THE RESTART STORED AT 00000 WILL NOT OPERATE CORRECTLY IF THE PROGRAM
        IS STOPPED WITHIN AN AREA WHERE ANY SORT OF TRAP SEQUENCE IS
        WORKING. HOWEVER, THE RESTART WILL BE RESTORED AFTER EACH TRAP
        SECTION.

    4.  THE CONTROL WORDS FOR CHANNEL OPERATION AND READ WRITE AREAS, ARE
        STORED IN THE HIGHEST AREA OF ANY SIZE STORAGE, TO TEST THE HIGH ORDER
        POSITIONS OF THE DATA REGISTERS, ADDRESS REGISTERS, AND LOCATION 
        REGISTERS.


                                                                   9SY1A
                                                                   3-1-59
                                                                   PAGE 1.008


        IF A RESET AND START IS PERFORMED FROM THE CONSOLE. THE PROGRAM WILL
        AUTOMATICALLY RESET TO ITS INITIAL STATE AND RETURN TO HALT TO ENTER
        CONTROL IN MODIFICATION PROGRAM.

    7.  THIS PROGRAM MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE IN PIN POINTING ERRORS. IF AN
        ERROR IS DETECTED, THE UNIT AND TYPE OF ERROR WILL BE INDICATED.
        HOWEVER, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT WHEN TROUBLE SHOOTING. ONE OF THE
        SMALLER PROGRAMS TESTING THE UNIT IN ERROR BE USED.
 
        THROUGH NECESSITY, BECUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MAIN FRAME
        TESTING, THE LOOP RETURNS ARE EXTREMELY LONG IN THE SECOND HALF
        SECTIONS.

    NOTE -- IN ORDER TO OPERATE CRT AND TAPES CONCURRENTLY TWO ENGINEERING
        CHANGES MUST BE ON THE COMPUER. THEY ARE E.C. =245719 AND E.C.
        =245680.

        PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SKIPPED.

        THE PRINTOUT WILL SHOW THE LOCATION THE PROGRAM SKIPPED TO IN
        THE DECREMENT OF THE INDICATORS. EXAMINE THE-SECTION COMPLETE-
        PRINTOUT TO DETERMINE WHICH SECTION THE SKIP OUT OCCURRED.
        IF THE SKIP OUT OCCURRED IN A FLOATING POINT SECTION, THE
        ADDRESS OF THE INDICATORS- IN THE-SPACE-PRINTOUT-WILL GIVE THE
        BEGINNING ADDRESS OF THE SECTION WHERE THE SKIP OUT OCCURRED.
        IF THE SKIP OUT DID NOT OCCUR IN A FLOATING POINT SECTION.
        IGNORE THE ADDRESS OF THE INDICATORS.
   
    15. TO PLACE PROGRAM ON DIAGNOSTIC TAPE AND READIT IN WITH 9T10

        3.  ADD-9LREW, LOW REWINDER-IN FRONT OF TRANFER CARD-CARD 355.
   
    NOTE -- THE ASSIGNMENT OF A PARTICULAR PANEL KEY TO 9SY1 WILL DEPEND
            UPON WHICH FILE 9SY1 HAS BEEN PLACED ON TAPE. SEE 9T10.

        4.  IN READING 9SY1 BACK FROM TAPE. ENTER CORRECT
            CONSOLE KEY CORRESPONDING TO THE FILE ON TAPE CONTAINING
