                729 MULTI-CHANNEL TEST

A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

     1.  TO CHECK TAPE INFORMATION FLOW IN MULIT-CHANNEL OPERATION.

B.  METHOD OF TEST

     1.  THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS -- A WRITE AND READ
         CHECK USING A 100 WORD RECORD OF A FIXED PATTERN WRITTEN
         FROM SYMBOLIC LOCATION FIX IN LISTING -- AND A WRITE AND
         READ CHECK USIGNG 100 RANDOM LENGTH, RANDOM WORD RECORDS.

     2.  THIS PROGRAM WRITES AND READS ON UP THROUGH 4 CHANNELS
         SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT IS WRITTEN FOR UNIT 1 ON EACH
         CHANNEL AND IS ADJUSTED FOR UP THROUGH 1 FRAMES ON
         EACH CHANNEL BY 9IOM AS SPECIFIED BY CONTRIL WORDS
         ENTERED AT BEGNNING OF TEST.  SEE E NORMAL STOPS.

     3.  THIS PROGRAM USES THE STANDARD 709 ERROR PRINT ROUTINE
         9DEPR FOR ERROR INDICATION AND PROGRAM CONTROL.

C.  AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

     1. UNITS    MF, CF, PR, DS AND TAPE UNITS TO BE TESTED.

     2.  SENSE SWITCH CONTROL

         SENSE SWITCHES 1, 2, 3 AND 4 ARE USED BY 9DEPR. SEE
         WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THESE USE
         WHICH IS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS

        A.  SWITCH 1 UP - TEST SENSE SWITCH 4

            SWITCH 1 DN - REPEAT TEST LOOP

        B.  SWITCH 2 UP - INDICATE ERROR - TEST SSW 3 TO
                          PRINT OR HALT

            SWITCH 2 DN - BYPASS ERROR INDICATION - TEST SSW 1
        C.  SWITCH 3 UP - PRINT OUT IF SSW 2 UP THEN TEST SSW 1
            SWITCH 3 DN - STOP ON ERRRO IF SSW 1 IS UP. THEN
                          TEST SSW 1

        D.  SWITCH 4 UP - PROCEED TO NEXT TEST ROUTINE

            SWITCH 4 DN - REPEAT SECTION N TIMES. OR IF ERROR
                          OCCURS GO TO NEXT SECTION

        E.  SWITCH 5 UP - GO TO 9IOM TO ADJUST PROGRAM
                          TO REPEAT SAME SEQUENCE OF UNITS

            SWITCH 5 DN - GO TO 9IOM AND HALT TO ENTER
                          NEW CHANNEL CONTROL WORDS

        F.  SWITCH 6 UP - END TEST - CALL IN NEXT PROGRAM
            SWITCH 6 DN - TEST SSW 5

E.  NORMAL STOPS

    1.   STOPS AT BEGINNING OF PROGRAM TO ENTER ON KEYS THE
         CONTROL WORDS FOR CHANNELS AND UNITS USED IN
         MODIFICATION ROUTINE 9IOM. ONE, TWO  OR THREE STOPS
         WILL OCCUR CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER OF DS TO BE TESTED
         AS SPECIFIED BY THE TAG BITS OF FIRST CONTROL WORDS.

              A TAG OF 1 SPECIFIES CHN A AND/OR B
              A TAG OF 2 SPECIFIES CHN C AND/OR D
              A TAG OF 4 SPECIFIES CHN E AND/OR F

         IF MORE THEN ONE DS IS TO BE TESTED. THEN THE FIRST
         CONTROL WORD SHOULD CONTAIN A MULTIPLE TAG.

         05527   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR FIRST DS ON KEYS
                 TAG FOR ALL DS TO BE TESTED
                 PRESS START

         05555   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHNN C AND/OR D
                 PRESS START

         05540   ENTER CONTROL WORD FOR CHN E AND/OR F
                 PRESS START

         05525   CONTROL WORD FAILED TO CONTAIN A TAG FOR ANY
                 DS. RE-ENTER FIRST CONTROL WORD WITH TAG
                 PRESS START

         SEE CONTROL WORD FORMAT

F.  ERROR STOPS

     1.  9DEPR ERROR INDICATION STOPS WITH SSW 3 DOWN

         06527   INDEX REGISTER C CONTAINS THE TWOS COMPLEMENT
                 OF THE ERRROR EXIT ADDRESS. READ LIGHTS THAT ARE
                 OUT + 1 AND CONSULT THAT ADDRESS IN PROGRAM
                 LISTING FOR ERROR ANALYSIS.

         06545   SAME AS ABOVE
                 PUSH START TO CONTINUE PROGRAM

G.  ERROR PRINT OUTS

         SEE WRITE UP FOR 9DEPR FOR EXAMPLE AND DESCRIPTION
         OF PRINT OUT.

         TEST LOC IS ADDRESS OF ENTRY TO ROUTINE IN WHICH
         ERROR OCCURED. OPN IS THE INSTRUCTION MOST BASIC
         TO THE CONDITION BEING TESTED IN FAILING ROUTINE.
         ERROR ADR IS THE EXIT FROM THE FAILING ROUTINE TO
         9DEPR

H.  COMMENTS

     1.  A POST RESTART IS INCLUDED WHICH STORES AT LOCATION
         ZERO A TRANSFER TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FRAME TEST.
         ANY TIME THE CONSOLE IS RESET. PRESSING START WILL

                                                      9 T 0 3 A

                                                      PAGE 1.004

         TRANSFER THE PROGRAM TO BEGIN TESTING THE CURRENT
         FRAME.

     2.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE ERROR PRINT
         OUT IS THE ERRRO ADR. BY REFERRING TO THIS ADDRESS
         IN THE PROGRAM LISTING. THE ROUTINE WHICH FAILED MAY BE
         LOCATED. BY ANALYZING THE ROUTINE WITH THE AID OF THE
         PROGRAM COMMENTS. IT IS HOPED THE CUSTOMER ENGINEER
         WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MACHINE
         FAILED AND SO HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO DIAGNOSE
         THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION.
