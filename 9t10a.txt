               9T10A DIAGNOSTIC TAPE PROGRAM
            PROGRAM TO WRITE DIAGNOSTICS ON TAPE

A.     PURPOSE OF PROGRAM

    1. TO PROVIDE A PROGRAM TO WRITE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM CARD DECKS ON TAPE.
    2. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO MODIFY THE DIAGNOSTIC TAPE, ONCE IT
       HAS BEEN WRITTEN, FOR ADDITIONS OR CORRECTIONS.

B.     METHOD OF PROGRAM

       1.  GENERATING THE ORIGNAL TAPE.

           THIS PROGRAM READS IN PROGRAM DECKS AND WRITES EACH DECK
           ON TAPE AS A FILE.

           THE PROGRAM DECKS SHOULD BE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER WHEN WIRTING
           A TAPE.

       A.  THE FIRST PROGRAM WRITTEN IS AN ADJUSTED 9M06A PROGRAM DECK.
           THIS IS PLACED AS THE FIRST PROGRAM SINCE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN
           MADE SO PROGRAM MAY BE MANUALLY LOADED OR LOADED BY LOAD TAPE
           BUTTON.

       B.  THE SECOND PROGRAM IS 9S01A HIGH AND LOW.

       C.  THE THIRD PROGRAM IS 9T11A, WHICH IS THE SEARCH PROGRAM TO BE
           USED FOR READING IN OTHER PROGRAMS.

           THE ABOVE SEQUENCE IS THE BASIC GROUP, WHICH INCLUDESS A PROGRAM
           TO TEST C.P.U. BEFORE RUNNING OTHER PROGRAMS AND A STORAGE
           PROGRAM TO TEST MEMORY.

       D.  THE REMAINING PROGRAMS ON TAPE ARE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS. THEY MAY
           BE PLACED IN ANY ORDER. HOWEVER A SUGGESTED ORDER IS LISTED IN
           SECTION II A.

       2.  MODIFYING AN EXISTING TAPE.

           WHEN MODIFYING EXISTING TAPE YOU WILL BE DOING TWO OPERATIUONS,
           EITHER CORRECTIONS OR MAKING ADDITIONS AT END OF TAPE.

       3.  IF PROGRAM IS USED TO GENERATE A NEW TAPE. SENSE SWITCH 5 WILL

                                                            9T10A
                                                            11/1/58

           BE UP.

           IF PROGRAM IS USED TO MODIFY AN EXISTING DIAGNOSTIC TAPE, SWITCH
           5 WILL BE DOWN, WHEN CORRECTIONS ARE MADE A NEW DIAGNOSTIC
           TAPE IS WRITTEN. WHEN ADDITIONSS ARE MADE, THEY ARE WRITTEN
           ON THE EXISTING DIAGNOSTIC TAPE.


    AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

    1.  MF, CF, CR, DS

        A.  TO GENERATE A NEW DIAGNOSTIC TAPE. PLACE NEW TAPE ON CHANNEL B
            TAPE 1.

        B.  TO MODIFY AN EXISTING DIAGNOSTIC TAPE WITH CORRECTIONS. PUT
            EXISTING TAPE ON CHANNEL A TAPE 1. NEW TAPE TO BE WRITTEN MUST
            BE ON CHANNEL B TAPE 1.

        C.  TO MODIFY A DIAGNOSTIC TAPE BY ADDING NEW DECKS TO REAR OF TAPE,
            PUT PRESENT TAPE ON CHB TAPE 1.

    2.  STORAGE LOCATIONS - 00030 - 00400.

        ON TAPE.




        1.  9M05A - FLOATING POINT TEST HAS TWO TRANSFER CARDS. THE FIRST TRANSFER
                    CARD 184 SHOULD BE WRITTEN ON TAPE FOR IT IS THE NORMAL
                    TRANSFER.

                    THE SECOND TRANSFER CARD 185 IS FOR TRACING. MANUALLY
                    TRANSFER INTO TRACING ROUTINE WHEN USING 9M05A FOR TRACING.
                    REMOVE CARD 185 BEFORE WRITING ON TAPE.

        2.  9S04A LOW + 9S05A LOW

                    CARD 49 IN 9S04AL AND CARD 44 IN 9S05AL HAVE A MINUS TRA.
                    IN 9 ROW LEFT WHICH IS OF NO USE. REPLACE WITH A BLANK SO THAT
                    AN EOF MAY BE WRITTEN WHEN WRITING A DIAGNOSTIC TAPE.

        3.  9COMA - DO NOT WRITE CARD 095 ON TAPE. THIS CARD BY-PASSES DRUM. TO
                    BY-PASS DRUM WHEN USING THIS PROGRAM. STORE A TRANSFER 1145
                    AT LOCATION 1117 MANUALLY. REMOVE CARD 095 WHEN WRITING TAPE.

        4.  FOR PROGRAMS REQUIRING TEST CARDS, DO NOT WRITE TEST CARDS ON TAPE.
            TEST CARDS SHOULD BE LOADED IN CARD READER, WHEN DIAGNOSTIC HAS BEEN
            READ OFF TAPE AND READY FOR TESTING. ONE SUCH PROGRAM IS 9C01A.


IB. SEQUENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC FILE-



    IF AN INSTALLATION DESIRES A SEQUENTIAL FILE ON TAPE WITH A GROUP OF
    DIAGNOSTICS TO BE EXECUTED IN SEQUENCE WITHOUT REWINDING AFTER EACH
    TEST, THIS CAN BE DONE IF THE REWIND CARD AND BLANKS ARE REMOVED, EXECPT
    FOR LAST DECK IN FILE. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A FILE USING 9M01, 9M02,
    9S01 AND 9T01 IS-
