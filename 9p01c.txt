                709 ON-LINE PRINTER

           DIAGNOSTIC AND RELIABILITY TEST

A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   To test the performance of the 716 Printer and related circuits of the
   766 Data Synchronizer as an output component of the 709 System. It is
   designed to be a combination of diagnostic and reliability check of the
   printer operation under program control.

   In particular, it covers print wheel and magnets, calculator entries
   and exits, print entries, echo exits all coselectors and pilot selectors,
   the 912 programmed carriage and a comprehensive exercise of the the
   766 Circuitry under read and write printer.  A survey of worst case
   printer patterns was made and teh resutls incorporated in as easily
   diagnosable form as possible in an attempt to force marginal components
   and adjustments into a detectable and diagnosable condition on preventative
   maintenance time rather than in customer operation.

B. METHOD OF TEST

   9P01 is divided into two distinct sections.
   
   1. Part one includes the select and interlock test, the printer electrical
      and mechanical tests, the data synchronizer control word tests, the
      subroutine package and the constants.  All of this is contained in the
      first 4096 locations of storage regardless of the core memory size.
   
   2. Part two contains the printer carriage control test and its associated
      constants and may be contained in core storage above 4096. In the
      case of a 4k core memory, Part Two will be read in after Part One has
      been run and relace portions of Part One.  A core size test provides
      for this feature automatically.
   
      In order to reduce storage space requirements and to make program
      flow more visible to user, the detailed operations of Data
      Synchronizer Register Checking, Echo Checking and certain often
      repeated print l..ys have been placed in subroutines.  Once the operation
      of the subroutine is understood, it can be largely ignored in following the
      flow of the program.  Strong stress has been placed upon making loop
      lock-in on failure convenient and sure.  At many places in the program,
      "NOP" instructions have been placed to facilitate quick custom build
      diagnostic loops for elusive failures.

                                                                9P01-C WRITE UP
                                                                PAGE 2



      Most of the testing is done under read printer in order to get
      maximum error detection and diagnosis.  However, write printer
      is thoroughly exerised in teh Data Synchronizer control word
      tests as well as in the mechanical and electrical test section.
      
      A modified form of 9IOM allows this program to check the printer
      on any channel on line.  Standard entry key formats apply.
      
      All types of errors that are program detectable are printed out.
      Each type of error has its own distinctive printout to provide
      maximum information with minimum interpretation.
      
      Each subroutine is provided with a desciption of its purpose and
      method of linkage to the main flow of the program printed with its
      listing.  This provides a ready reference at the point of use.

   2. 716 Printer Control Board

      a.  A slightly revised but completely redrawn printer board wiring
          diagram is part of 9P01-C and the board it descibres must be
          used to properly run 9P01-C.  This board is compatible with all 
          present diagnostics execpt 9P01-A and 9P01-B, which it supercedes.

\l                                                            Page 2

          For normal operations of the printer it is compatible with the
          Share II Board.  With Alteration Switch I -ON- it permits proper
          printout of program assembly operations using 709-DAP or
          SE-DAP. (For 709-DAP or SE-DAP, a carriage tape with no
          overflow punch should be used).
       
       b. Board sense exit functions are as follows:
       
          Sense Exit                 Function

          7 + 2                      Extra space
          6, 7, 10 + 2               Selective space before printing

          6, 8, 10 + 2               Skip to 5
          10 + 2                     Skip to 6
          7, 10 + 2                  Skip to 7
          8, 10 + 2                  Skip to 8
                                    
          7, 8, 10 + 2               Skip to 9
          6, 10 + 2                  Skip to 10r
          6, 7, 8 + 2                Suppress space
          7, 8 + 2                   Suppress space + extra space
          6, 7, 8, 10 + 2            Selective space, suppress space and
                                     extra space.  Makes selective space
                                     a completely after print operations.
                                    
          8 + 2                      Selective space and extra space.
                                     Selective space before print and
                                     again after print.
         
          When Sense Exit -2- is used as a "hot shot" to energize a 
          coselector tree, there must be a 2 millisecond delay between
          the rest of teh sense exit instructions and the sense exit -2-
          instruction to allow coselector transfer.

       c. Alteration Switch 1 -ON- connects the overflow hub to skip to
          one, thus allowing overflow without program intervention.
          Since the printer test is designed to run with this switch -OFF-,
          improper overflows will occur on 120 character print lines if
          the switch is left on while runnning this test.  Overflow switch 1
          -ON- also connects sense exit 7 to sense entry to allow printer
          board to check compatible with the Share II board.
       
       d. Alteration Switch 4 -ON- places the printer in Non Print status.

G. PRINT-OUTS

   Normal - See examples of proper print-outs following this write up.

   Error - See examples of error print-outs following the correct print-out
           which follow this write up.  Sense switch 3 must be -UP-.

   Two Error Printouts are of specail note -

   1.  The echo check error print consits of six lines of print as follows:

       a.  An echo error occurred on the previous line of test
           pattern printout.

       b.  Program exit at - XXXXX.  Section starts at - YYYYY.
          
       c.  A line of numbers which represents the units position of the
           print columns being printed.
          
       d.  The print line in which the error occurred printed under write
           printer instead of read printer.
          
       e.  A line of print representing the echo image with the 8-4 and
           8-3 rows inserted into the 8 and 3 ros of the echo image.
          
       f.  A line of print resulting from a print image built by an exclusive
           -OR- of the corresponding words of the print and echo images.
           In other words, the error bit image.

   2. The print image modification check error print is similar to the
      echo check print out except that all its references aer to the modified
      and unmodified print images.

      a.   The print image was modified during the previous line of printout.

                                                                PAGE 8

      b.   Program exit at - XXXXX.  Section starts at - YYYYY.
          
      c.   A line of numerals corresponding to the units position of the
           typewheels printed.
          
      d.   The line of unmodified test pattern printed under WPR.
          
      e.   The line of modified test pattern printed under WPR.
          
      f.   A line of print representing the error bit pattern produced by
           an exclusive -OR- of the two images.

H. COMMENTS
  
   1.  A sequence checking and wild transfer subroutine similar to the
       monitor routine in 9M05A and 9COMB is provided to insure that
       the program does not get lost.
     
   2.  The # sign used just to the left of the symbolic operation code
       indicates that the instruction is part of an error routine.
     
   3.  At various places in the listing comment field a single -X- is used
       to denote ditto marks or a continuation of the action described in
       a preceding comment.
     
   4.  Program loading instructions are as follows:
     
       a.  Place new 9P01 printer board wired to the diagram supplied
           at the end of this write up in the printer and make printer
           ready.
          
       b.  Ready the 9P01 deck in the card reader.
          
       c.  Press load cards button.  Program will read in the first 150
           cards and stop.
          
       d.  When machines stops enter the desired I/O format as detailed
           in Section E (normal stops) above into the entry keys and press
           start.  Program will execute automatically thereafter.
          
           NOTE - In the case of a machine with a 4K Memory, part
           one will execute under control of sense switch 6 and will
           not enter part two until sense switch 6 is raised.  After
           part two has executed, part one can only be re-entered by
           reading in the deck a second time.
          
          
\l                                                               Page 8

                                                                9P01-C WRITE UP
                                                                PAGE 9
          
           In contrast, a machine with a memory larger than 4K handles
           part two as a direct continuation of part one and does not
           refer to sense switch 6 until after part two is completed. The
           complete program will execute as long as sense switch 6 is
           down.
     
   5.  The complete test requires approximately 8 minutes pre pass assuming
       no errors.
