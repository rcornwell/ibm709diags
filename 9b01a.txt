I. COMMENTS

   1.  THERE ARE EIGHT POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF BUFFER CONTROL TRIGGERS.
       S,1,2 AND ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF THESE WILL TOTAL EIGHT.  THE
       FIRST SECTION OF THE PROGRAM, WILL FORCE A DISCONNECT, AND HALT IF
       THE FIRST RCH IN EACH SEQUENCE DOES NOT SET THE DSC CORRECTLY.

   2.  SECTION 1-SWITCH #5 UP.

       EACH TRIGGER IS TESTED INDIVIDUALLY, AND IN ALL COMBINATIONS WITH
       THE OTHERS, AS FOLLOWS.

       A.  BCD SHIFT IMAGE.  PUNCH AND READ THREE CARDS AND WRITE
           PRINTER, THREE LINES, FOR EACH COMBINATION.  FIRST CHARACTER
           WILL REMAIN THE SAME FOR EACH OF THREE CARDS, AND THREE LINES.

           1.  ALL TRIGGERS OFF-IOCD/COUNT AND DISCONNECT.

               S TRIGGER ON-IOCP/COUNT AND PROCEED.

               TRIGGERS S,1,2 ON-IOST/SIGNAL AND TRANSFER.

       B.  THERE WILL BE 24 CARDS PUNCHED AND READ, AND 24 LINES PRINTED
           WITH TRIGGERS, AS ABOVE. THERE WILL ALSO BE 24 ADDITIONAL
           CARDS PUNCHED AND READ, AND 24 LINES PRINTED WITH AS MANY
           TRIGGERS AS POSSIBLE USED IN EACH CYCLE.

      NOTE--THERE WILL BE ONE BLANK CARD PASSED AND ONE NON-PRINT LINE
             TO TEST THAT RCH WITH WC-0 WILL SEND EACH CARD MACHINE THROUGH
             A CYCLE.

       C.  RCH, LCH, AND SCH ARE TESTED INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED, AND
           INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED AND INDEXED, IN THE PRINTER SECTION.


   3.  SECTION 2-SWITCH #5 DOWN.

           THIS IS PRIMARILY A RELIABILITY SECTION, TO BE USED UNDER BIAS.

           RANDOM BINARY CARDS WILL BE PUNCHED AND READ, AND READ PRINTER
           WILL BE TESTED WITH A SHIFTING BCD IMAGE.  AS MANY BUFFER
           CONTROL TRIGGERS AS POSSIBLE ARE USED DURING EACH CARD CYCLE.

           IF ALL THREE CARD MACHINES ARE SELECTED, THIS SECTION WILL PUNCH
           A CARD, READ A CARD, AND PRINT A LINE, FOR 24 CARDS.

       NOTE--THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH BEING THE CASE, IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE TO
             SELECT ONLY THE PUNCH ON THE FIRST PASS, IF A PREPUNCHED
             DECK IS NOT AVAILABLE.
