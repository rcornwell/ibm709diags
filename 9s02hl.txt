A.  PURPOSE

    1.  9S02 H AND 9S02 L WILL TEST A 4K, 8K, OR 16K STORAGE. IT SHOULD NOT
        BE USED ON A 738 AS THE PATTERN WILL BE INCORRECT.

    2.  THE CORE STORAGE IS TESTED BY PUTTING THE PATTERN BELOW PHYSICALLY IN
        STORAGE

         AS THE ACTUAL PROGRAM LOCATIONS DIFFER FROM THE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS, A
         MEMORY PRINTOUT WILL SHOW BLOCKS OF MEMORY LIKE THIS

        9S02 H  0240                9S02 L 77514
    
    3.  PROGRAM ERROR STOP

        IF A COMPLEMENT ERROR
        ERROR WORD IN MQ

    4.  PRESS START BUTTON TO RETURN TO PROGRAM. THE ERROR IS CORRECTED AND THE
        TEST CONTINUES.

E.  EXAMPLE OF PRINTOUT

    THE FIRST LINE OF THE PRINTOUT CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE WORD IN ERROR
    AND THE ERROR WORD. THE SECOND LINE CONTAINS AN INDICATION AS TO WHETHER IT
    IS AN INITIAL OR COMPLEMENT ERROR AND WHAT THE ERROR WORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
    THE FIRST POSITION OF THE WORD IS THE SIGN POSITION.
    EXAMPLE I
    000010111011               111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 101 111 111
                               111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111

    IN EXAMPLE I AN INITIAL ERROR OCCURRED AT ADDRESS 273. ALL ONES SHOULD HAVE

                                                                      9S02HA-LA
                                                                      7-01-58
                                                                      PAGE 1.002
 
    BEEN WRITTEN. THE ERROR WORD HAS DROPPED A ONE IN POSITION 28.

    EXAMPLE 2.
    000010111011               000 000 010 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
                  111111111111 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000

    IN EXAMPLE 2 A COMPLEMENT ERROR OCCURRED AT ADDRESS 273. ALL ZEROS SHOULD
    HAVE BEEN WRITTEN. THE ERROR WORD HAS PICKED UP A ONE IN POSITION 7, THE
    GROUP OF ONES IN THE SECOND LINE INDICATE WHEN A COMPLEMENT ERROR OCCURS.

F.  COMMENTS

    1.  THE PROGRAM TAKES ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL PASS IN ONE
    CORE STORAGE.

    2.  THE PROGRAM WRITES A COMPLETE PATTERN, CHECKS EACH WORD, COMPLEMENTS
    THE WORD, CHECKS THE COMPLEMENT AND THEN RESTORES THE PATTERN. AFTER ONE
    COMPLETE PATTERN IS READ, THE PROGRAM THEN WRITES AND CHECKS AN INVERSE
    PATTERN.

    3.  THE PROGRAM MAY FAIL DUE TO AN ALTERATION IN THE PROGRAM ITSELF DUE TO
    A STORAGE FAILURE.

    4.  PROGRAM 9S02 H WILL LOAD INTO THE FIRST 315 LOCATIONS IN STORAGE AND
    WILL TEST ALL OF THE AVAILABLE STORAGE ABOVE 206. PROGRAM 9S02 L WILL LOAD
    INTO THE LAST 315 LOCATIONS AVAILABLE IN STORAGE AND WILL TEST ALL OF THE
    REST OF STORAGE.

    5.  BOTH PROGRAM 9S02 H AND 9S02 L SHOULD BE RUN TO CHECK ALL OF THE
    STORAGE AREA. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE USED WITH ONLY 737 CORE
    STORAGES. THE PROGRAM TESTS FOR THE SIZE OF STORAGE AND THE ADJUSTS THE
    PROGRAM ACCORDINGLY. THE TEST WILL THEN WIPE OUT THE AREA WHICH WAS USED TO
    TEST THE SIZE OF STORAGE.

    6.  THE TEST WORDS WHICH ARE USED IN THIS TEST ARE LOCATED AT 171 AND 172 IN
    9S02 H AND AT 77774 AND 77775 IN 9S02 L
    THESE TWO TEST WORD WILL ALTERNATE THROUGH THE NORMAL OPERATION OF THE TEST.

    7.  IF A PATTERN OTHER THEN ALL ONES OR ALL ZEROS IS DESIRED IN THIS TEST,
    JUST CHANGE THE TWO TEST WORDS AND RUN THE TEST.
    THE PROGRAM WILL RUN CORRECTLY FOR ANY TEST WORDS.

    8.  DURING THE FIRST PASS THE TEST FOR SIZE OF STORAGE WILL BE WRITTEN OVER.
    IF A RESTART IS NEEDED, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO TRANSFER MANUALLY TO 0000 OR
    77570
