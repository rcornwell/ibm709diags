                 BUFFER - TAPE TEST


A.  PURPOSE OF TEST

    1.  To test data transmission from main frame to buffer and tape

    2.  Method of Test

        a.  The first section tests buffer and tape synchronizer instruction
            and transmission of information for channels A, C or E. Tape
            unit one is used in each case except when the diagnostic is on
            Channel A, T. U. 1.  Tape unit two is used for reading and
            writing when the diagnostic is read from tape.

        b.  The second section tests buffer and tape synchronizer instructions
            and transmission of information for channels B, D, or F. Tape
            unit one is used in each case.

        c.  The third section tests the ability of buffer to transmit infor-
            mation on both channels A and B, C and D, or E and F.  Tape
            unit one is used in each case, except for A when program is
            read from tape.

        d.  The standard diagnositc print routine will be used throughout
            the program as a means of testing sense switches, and also a
            means of typing out any machine errors. See listing of 9DEPR.
            The linkage to the print routine will be through the use of a TSX
            of index register C.

    2. Sense Switch Control

       Sense switches 1, 3, 3, and 4 are used by 9DEPR. See writeup for
       9DEPR for detailed description of their use which is briefly as follows:

       a.  Switch 1 UP    -     Test sense switch 4
           Switch 1 DOWN  -     Repeat Test Loop

       b.  Switch 2 UP    -     Indicate error - Test SSW3 to Print or halt
           Switch 2 DOWN  -     Bypass error indication - test SSW1

       c.  Switch 3 UP    -     Printout if SSW 2 up then test SSW1
           Switch 3 DOWN  -     Stop on error. If SSW2 is up, then test SSW1

       d.  Switch 4 UP    -     Proceed to next test routine
           Switch 4 DOWN  -     Repeat section N times, or if error occurrs
                                to next section.

       e.  Switch 5 UP    -     Proceed to next test routine
           Switch 5 DOWN  -     Repeat same sequence of units

       f.  Switch 6 UP    -     End test - call in next program
           Switch 6 DOWN  -     Repeat entire program

D.  NORMAL STOPS
    Stops at beginning of program to enter control words on the keys for
    channels and units used in modification routine 9IOM.  One, two or
    three stops will occur corresponding to the number of DS to be tested
    as specified by the tag bits of the first control word.

              A tag of 1 specifies CHN A and/or B
              A tag of 2 specifies CHN C and/or D
              A tag of 4 specifies CHN E and/or F

   If more then one DS is to be tested, then the first control word should
   contain a multiple tag.

            tested Press Start

    05533   Enter control word for CHN C and/or D Press Start

    05540   Enter control word for CHN E and/or F Press Start

    05525   Control word failed to contain a tag for any DS Re-enter
            first control word with tag Press Start

E.  ERROR STOPS

    9DEPR   Error Indication Stops with SSW3 Down

    06517   Index Register C contains the twos complement of the error
            exit address.  Read lights that are out and add 1 and consult
            that address in program listing for error analysis.

    06545   Same as above
            Push start to continue program

F.  PRINT OUTS

    1.  Normal Print Outs

        "NOW PERFORMING DIAGNOSTIC TEST 9T02"
        "PASS COMPLETE CHANNELS A AND B"
        OR "PASS COMPLETE CHANNEL A" PRINTED IF CHANNEL B IS
        NOT TESTED OR "PASSS COMPLETE CHANNEL B" PRINTED IF
        CHANNEL A IS NOT TESTED

        9T02 PASS COMPLETE - ALL UNITS CALLED"

        Pass complete is similarly printed out for channels C, D, E, and
        F after they have been tested.

    2.  Error Print Outs

        See Write up for 9DEPR for example and description of print out

G.   COMMENTS

     If both channels are to be tested individually, the program will auto-
     matically test multichannel operation.

     Tape unit one on each channel is tested. If the diagnostic is read from
     tape unit one, channel A, then tape unit two will be tested on Channel A.
