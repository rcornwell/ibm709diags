A. UNIT TESTED

   1. PURPOSE OF TEST
    
      TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST OF ALL INDEXING INSTRUCTIONS AND INDEX
      REGISTERS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE TAG INDEXING.

   2. METHOD OF TEST
    
      THIS PROGRAM MAY BE DIVIDED INTO 5 PARTS

      A. 000000-01411 A BASIC TEST WHICH STARTS WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT
                      ONLY HTR AND AXT ARE WORKING AND CHECKS THAT THE 20
                      INDEXING INSTRUCTIONS ARE OPERATING CORRECTLY. THIS
                      PART OF THE TEST CHECKS THE DECODING, OPERATION AND
                      ROUTING OF EACH INSTRUCTION RATHER THEN THE REGISTERS
                      THEMSELVES, SINCE ONLY XRA IS USED.

      B. 01412-01763 SIZE OF STORAGE TEST-TESTS FOR A 4,8,16 OR 32K
                     STORAGE AND SETS APPORRIATE CONSTANTS.

      C. 01764-06733 COMPREHENISIVE TEST OF ALL INDEX REGISTERS, INCLUDING
                     MULTIPLE TAG INDEXING.

      D. 06734 PRINT SECTION FOR PROGRAM NAME.

      E. 06771 PRINT SECTION FOR PASS COMPLETE.

B. AREA OF MACHINE REQUIRED

   1.  MF, CF, CR, AND PR.

G. SWITCH #4   UP               COUNT BY 1
H. SWITCH #4 DOWN               TEST SWITCH #3
I. SWITCH #5 UP                 BYPASS HPR AND TSX HALT
J. SWITCH #5 DOWN               TEST HPR AND TSX ON HALT
K. SWITCH #6 UP                 CALL IN NEXT DIAGNOSTIC
L. SWITCH #6 DOWN               REPEAT COMPLETE TEST

NORMAL STOPS

00000 - AFTER PRINTING OUT THE PROGRAM NAME, THE MACHINE WILL STOP IN ORDER
        TO CHECK HTR TO 00001. HOWEVER, FOR ALL FOLLOWING PASSES THE PROGRAM 
        NAME WILL NOT BE PRINTED OUT NORE WILL THERE BE A STOP AT 00000 AS
        THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER TO 00001.

02660 - WITH SWITCH #5 DOWN - TEST HPR AND TSX FOR XRA.

04035 - WITH SWITCH #5 DOWN - TEST HPR AND TSX FOR XRB.

05211 - WITH SWITCH #5 DOWN - TEST HPR AND TSX FOR XRC.

ERROR STOPS

    SINCE THE FIRST PART OF THE PROGRAM - UP TO 01764-DOES NOT USE SENSE
    SWITCHES ALL ERROR STOPS WILL BE HTR.

    IN THE LAST PART OF THE PROGRAM -BEYOND 01764- AN ERROR STOP WILL
    APPEAR IN EACH SECTION FOLLOWING SENSE SWITCH #2 TEST.

    NOTE - SWITCH #2 MUST BE UP TO STOP ON ERROR.

PRINT OUTS

    THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT USE 4DEPR. IT DOES HOWEVER HAVE ITS OWN PRINT
    IMAGE FOR PROGRAM NAME, STORAGE SIZE, AND PASS COMPLETE.

G. COMMENTS

       THE STANDARD PRINT ROUTINE WAS NOT INCLUDED WITH THIS TEST, AS THE
       PRINT ROUTINE ITSELF USES A GREAT DEAL OF INDEXING.

       IF IT IS DESIRABLE TO TEST ONLY INDEX REGISTER A-PLACE A TRA TO 01764
       AT LOCATION 03136 AND TRANSFER MANUALLY TO 01764.

       TO LOOP IN XRB SECTION, PLACE A TRA TO 03140 AT LOCATION 04313
       AND TRANSFER MANUALLY TO 03140.

       TO LOOP IN XRC SECTION, PLACE A TRA TO 04315 IN 
       LOCATION 05467 AND TRANSFER MANUALLY TO 04315.

       TO LOOP IN MULTIPLE TAG INDEXING, PLACE TRA TO 05471 IN
       LOCATION 06565 AND TRANSFER MANUALLY TO 05471.
