                    SPECIAL FEATURE
            EXTENDED PRECISION FLOATING POINT
                     FOR 709 MACHINE

            B/M 580043              EC 298817

                  INTRODUCTORY WRITE-UP

UNIT TESTED - 709 CPU

A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   To give a comprehensive test of all the seven extended precision
   floating point instructions as provided by this Special Feature

B. METHOD OF TEST

   In order to give a comprehensive test of all these extended precision
   floating point instructions, this diagnostic program is divided into two
   separate independent sections, as follows:

   Section 1 - Tests the extended load (ELD) and extended store (EST)
               instructions.

   Section 2 - Tests the extended precision floating point arithmetic
               instructions. (EAD, ESB, EUA, EMP, EDP)

   The method of test as used in each section is discussed in the write-up
   for that section.
   This program assumes that all of MF is functional except the circuitry
   required for this special feature.

C. MACHINE UNITS AND STORAGE AREA

   1. UNITS REQUIRED
 
      MF, CF, DSU, CR, PR

   2. STORAGE LOCATIONS

      SECTION 1                       00000 - 01073

      SECTION 2                       00000 - 06435
                9DEPR                 06500 - 07713

      These sections are sepaarate programs.
      In the operation of each section, all of core storage is used.

                                                                   9EFPA
                                                                   1-1-60
                                                                   PAGE 1.0002

D. LOADING PROCEDURE

   Both sections are loaded into core storage by using the Standard High
   End Loader. (9LD02A)

E. PROGRAM CONTROL

   Program control as used by each section is discussed in write-up
   for that section.

              216 - 217    Two Blank Cards

       Operation of each section as separate programs:

       Section 1 - Remove 9EFPA 000 to 027 and insetr two blank cards
                   behind 9EFPA 027 and insert this deck into CR.

                   NOTE:  Section 1 does not use the DEPR print routine.
      
       Section 2 - Remove 9EFPA 028 and hight and insert this deck
                   into CR.

       As single loads, either section will load under SSW 6 control.
       This is the same procedure as used in loadng consecutive
       diagnostic programs.

                    SPECIAL FEATURE
            EXTENDED PRECISION FLOATING POINT
                     FOR 709 MACHINE

            B/M 580043              EC 298817

                        SECTION 1

A. PURPOSE OF TEST

   This section provides a comprehensive test of the EXTENDED LOAD
   (ELD) and EXTENDED STORE (EST) instructions as provided by this
   special feature.

B. METHOD OF TEST

   This section is divided into two parts:

     Part 1 - Cursory check of single addressing controls using
              the STO instuction.

     Part 2 - Checking ELD and EST for function.

   The brief description preceding each test routine gives the purpose
   and method of test of the test routine.

   In an effort to keep the number of locations used by this section at a
   minumum, no error printout is provided in this sections, and, also,
   the number of subroutines used in this sections are minimized. This
   allows more storage locations for checking addressing. To further
   assure that all solid or random addressing errors will be detected,
   each instruction provides test routines which address all unused
   portions of storage.

   Since no error printout is provided in this section, the machine will
   halt on all error indications.

C. PROGRAM CONTROL

   A Program Sequence Control is provided in this sections. This routine,
   located at the beginning of the program, checks SSW 1 to determine
   whether the test routine is to be repeated or whether the program goes
   to next test routine in sequence.

                                                                   1-1-60
