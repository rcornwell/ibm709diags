             709/704 COMPATABILITY AND EXECUTE INSTRUCTION PROGRAM

A.  UNITS TESTED-709 CPU AND CORE STORAGE

    1.  PURPOSE OF TEST

        A.  ABILITY TO NULLIFY HALF OF AN 8K, 16K OR 32K STORAGE

        B.  TEST 709 IN SPECIFIED MODES WILL TRAP WHEN ENCOUNTERING 709
            OR 704 I/O SELECT, SENSE, COPY OR LDA INSTRUCTIONS.
        *NOTE* 709 INSTRUCTIONS BTT AND ETT DO NOT TRAP AS PER THE
               COMPATABILITY FEATURE. SEE PAGE 12 AND 13 OF LISTING.

        C.  ABILITY OF 09 TO PERFORM 704 FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS
        
        D.  TEST THE EXECUTE INSTRUCTION

    2.  METHOD OF TEST
 
        A.  THE SELF LOADING PROCEDURE WITH 30 OCTAL WORDS PER CARD
            PROVIDEDS A MEANS OF LOADING THE DECK WITH THE LOAD CARDS
            BUTTON ON THE CPU CONSOLE OR WITH THE KEYS ON THE DSU.
            PAGE 1 OF LISTING EXPLAINS DSU LOADINGS.
 
        B.  TO INSURE THE DECK HAS BEEN READ INTO STORAGE CORRECTLY.
            A STORAGE CHECK SUM IS COMPUTED AND COMPARED WITH A 
            PREDETERMINED CHECK SUM.
 
        C.  A NORMAL PROGRAM STOP HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO GIVE THE C.E.
            IF HE DESIRES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVER AND/OR CHECK THE
            VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF TH COMPATABILITY FEATURE.

        D.  INITIALLY, THE PROGRAM TESTS FOR SIZE OF STORAGE. IF STORAGE
            IS LESS THEN 32K, ADDRESSES ARE MODIFIED TO CONFORM WITH
            AND 8K OR 16K STORAGE UNIT IN THE SYSTEM.
 
        E.  A MONITOR INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM TO CHECK THE CORRECT
            SEQUENCE OF TESTS.
       
        F.  IF LOGICAL DRUM 1 IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM, DEPRESSING KEY 1
            WILL ENABLE THE PROGRAM TO INSERT A BYPASS TO SKIP THE
            ROUTINE REQUIRING DRUM 1 TO BE ON LINE.
 
        G.  ERRORS IN THE COMPATABILITY SECTION ARE POINTED OUT BY HALTS
            TO AVOID FALSE ERROR INDICATORS. ERRORS IN THE EXECUTE 
            SECTION CAN BE INDICATOR BY HALTS OR A PRINTOUT DEPENDING 
            ON THE SENSE SWITCH 3 SECTIONS.

            THE INITIAL PORTION OF THE RESET BUTTON TEST IS SUCCESSFUL.
        
        3.  THE EXECUTE SECTION ONLY, WILL GIVE AN ERROR PRINTOUT IF AN
            ERROR IS ENCOUNTERED AND SENSE SWITCH 3 IS UP.

        4.  PROGRAM PRINTS *100 PROGRAM PASSES COMPLETE 9COM* AFTER EVERY
            100 PASSES IF SWITCH 3 IS UP AND SWITCH 6 IS DOWN.

    G.  COMMENTS
 
        1.  ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM LOCATION ARE 000000-04216, THE PROGRAM HAS
            AN EXIT ROUTINE FROM A SELECT, SENSE, COPY OR LDA TRAP IN
            LOCATION 40001 THRU 40006. LOCATIONS 40007 THRU 40017 ARE ALSO
            USED BY THE PROGRAM.

        2.  AFTER TESTING THE SIZE OF STORAGE AND ADJUSTING THE ADDRESS OF
            THE PROGRAM IF STORAGE IS NOT 32K, THE STR INSTRUCTION IS
            STORED IN ALL UNUSED LOCATION TO DETECT THE PROGRAM SKIPPING
            OUT OF CONTROL.

        3.  ENTRANCE TO THE MONITOR IS AT THE START OF EACH TEST TO INSURE
            CORRECT SEQUENTIAL PROGRESS OF THE PROGRAM
        
        4.  A MANUAL TRANSFER TO ANY TEST SHOULD BE TO THE INITIAL
            INSTRUCTION OF THE TEST WHICH IS ALWAYS AN AXT INSTRUCTION TO
            ITSELF. AVOID A FALSE ERROR STOP BY LEAVING KEYS DOWN. SINCE
            THE MONITOR CHECKS THE KEYS FOR A MANUAL TRANSFER

        5.  A PROGRAM STOP AT LOCATION 02541 INDICATES THE PROGRAM IS NOT
            PROGRESSING SEQUENTIALLY. THE DECREMENT OF ACCUMULATOR CONTAINS
            THE LOCATION THAT THE PROGRAM SKIPPED TO IN ERROR AND THE
            ADDRESS OF THE ACCUMULATOR CONTAINS THE INITIAL LOCATION OF THE
            TEST IN PROGRESS WHEN THE SKIP TOOK PLACE.

        6.  IF LOCATION 00002 IS IN THE DECREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATOR, IT IS 
            AN INDICATION THAT THE MACHINE TRAPPED TO LOCATION 40001 BUT
            FAILED TO STORE THE SELECT, SENSE, COPY OR LDA INSTRUCTION
            LOCATION PLUS ONE IN THE ADDRESS PORTION OF LOCATION 40000.

                                                             3/1/59
                                                             PAGE 1.009

        7.  IF, WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM, THERE IS A HANGUP CONDITION WITH
            THE INSTRUCTION COUNTER RESET TO ZERO, IT IS INDICATION THAT A
            SELECT, SENSE, COPY OR LDA INSTRUCTION FAILED TO STORE AND TRAP
            DISPLAY LOCATION 04161 AND THE DECREMENT PORTION WILL CONTAIN
            THE INITIAL LOCATION OF THE TEST IN PROGRESS WHEN THE HANGUP
            CONDITION OCCURRED.

        8.  SECTION E OF THIS WRITE UP NOTES ERROR STOP AND HANGUP LOCATIONS
            AND THE REASON FOR THE STOP. REFER TO THE LISTING FOR DETAILED
            COMMENTS WHICH MAY INDICATE THE SOURCE OF ANY TROUBLE.


        9.  WHEN 704 I/0 INSTRUCTIONS FAIL TO TRAP AND THE MACHINE IS HUNG
            UP WITH A HANGUP LOCATION IN THE INSTRUCTION COUNTER AND THE
            704 I/O INSTRUCTION IN THE STORAGE REGISTER, IT WILL BE
            NECESSARY TO RESET AND MANUALLY TRANSFER TO CONTINUE.

        10. WHEN BIASING WITH THIS PROGRAM, DEPRESS KEY 1 AT THE NORMAL
            PROGRAM STOP LOCATION 00017. THIS WILL BYPASS A READ DRUM
            ROUTINE AND PREVENT A DRUM HANGUP.

        11. BECAUSE OF THE MONITOR AND THE USE OF LOCATION 00000 BY THE 
            PROGRAM ITSELF, THERE IS NO RESET START PROVIDED. ANY TRANSFER
            TO THE START OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE A MANUAL TRANSFER TO
            LOCATION 00171.

        13. IF EC 245719 HAS NOT BEEN INSTALLED, THE MACHINE WILL HANG UP
            AT LOCATION 01171, IF DRUM ROUTINE WAS NOT BYPASSED IN INITIAL
            PART OF THE PROGRAM. IF DRUM WAS BYPASSED, A HANGUP WILL OCCUR
            AT LOCATION 02214 IF AT END OF TAPE OR AT LOCATION 02221 IF NOT
            AT END OF TAPE. THE HANGUPS ARE CAUSED BY RESET LOAD CHANNEL
            WITH ZEROS IN LOCATION 00437 DESTROYING THE FOLLOWING SELECT
            IN LOCATION 00453. THE DSU WILL HAVE UNIT 1 AND BCD NEONS ON
            PREVENTING THE EXECUTION OF ANOTHER SELECT INSTRUCTION. TO
            BYPASS THIS HANGUP UNTIL THE E.C. HAS BEEN INSTALLED, INSERT A
            TRA 00460 IN LOCATION 00451.

        14. 9DEPR IS LOCATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MAIN PROGRAM IN ORDER
            TO HAVE ONE BLOCK OF LOCATIONS IN STOREAGE FOR THE PROGRAM AREA
            AND THE UNUSED LOCATION FILLED WITH THE STR INSTRUCTION FOR THE
            PROGRAM MONITOR.
        
        15. THE RELEASE OF THIS PROGRAM OBSOLETES 9COMA.
