A.  UNIT TESTED-709 CPU
   
    1.  PURPOSE OF TEST
       
        THIS PROGRAM COMBINES 9M01 AND 9M02 WITH PORTIONS OF 9M03
            AND 9COM FOR A ONE 8K MEMORY LOAD MAIN FRAME TEST.
       
    2.  METHOD OF TEST
       
        A.  THE PROGRAM IS DIVIDED IN 3 PARTS.
           
        B.  THE FIRST PART PERFORMS A SECTION OF 9M03 WHICH TESTS THE INDEXING
            INSTRUCTIONS USED IN 9M21 AND HALTS ON ERROR.
           
        C.  THE SECOND PART PERFORMS THE TESTS OF 9M01, 9M02 AND A PART
            OF THE EXECUTE TESTS OF 9COM. THE SETTING OF SENSE SWITCH
            3 DETERMINES A PRINTOUT OR A HALT ON ERROR.
           
        D.  THE THIRD PART IS EXECUTED ONLY WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 DOWN
            AND PERFORMS TEST USING HALTS AND ADDER TESTS.

G.  COMMENTS
  
    1.  THERE IS A SHORT BASIC INDEXING TEST AT THE BEGINNING OF 9M21 TO
        TEST THE INDEXING INSTRUCTIONS USED THROUGHOUT THE DIAGNOSTIC.
        THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONLY CHECKED ON THE FIRST PASS THROUGH 9M21.
       
    2.  WITH SENSE SWITCH 5 DEPRESSED, TESTS USING HALTS AND THE LONG
        ADDER TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON THE INITIAL PASS. ON SUCCEEDING
        PASSES, ONLY THE LONG ADDER TEST ARE PERFORMED.
       
    3.  INDICATOR INSTRUCTIONS WITH A PRIMARY OP OF 0,4 ARE TESTED
        FOR FALSE TRAPPING. LOCATIONS 00001-00010 CONTAIN A SUBROUTINE
        TO TRANSFER TO THE MAIN PROGRAM IN CASE OF A FALSE TRAP.
       
    4.  THE RESTORING OF THE ACCUMULATOR BY CERTAIN INDICATOR INSTRUCTIONS
        ARE CHECKED. THIS SUBROUTINE IS IN LOCATIONS 16321-16347.
        IF THERE IS AN ERROR, THE MQ WILL CONTAIN THE LOCATION OF THE
        INSTRUCTION BEING TESTED AND THE ACCUMULATOR WILL CONTAIN THE ERROR
        INFORMATION.
       
    5.  CARD 343 IS A FAST MPY TEST CARD. HOWEVER, ANY CARD WITH ANY
        INFORMATION IN POSITIONS 1-35 OF THE 9 LEFT ROW CAN BE USED. THE
        TEST CARD SHOULD ALWAYS BE PLACED AFTER THE TRANSFER CARD.
       
    6.  THERE ARE 50 BLANK DECIMAL LOCATIONS FROM 06416-06477
        FOR ANY FUTURE ADDITIONS TO THE PROGRAM.
       
    7.  THE DIAGNOSTIC PRINT SUBROUTINE 9DEPR IS IN ITS NORMAL STANDARD
        LOCATIONS 06500-07712.
       
    8.  THE DECREMENT PORTION OF LOCATION 07570 CONTAINS THE 2-S COMPLEMENT
        OF THE LAST TEST ADDRESS PERFORMED CORRECTLY.
