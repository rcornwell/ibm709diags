                   CARD READER TIMING AND RELIABILITY TEST

A. Unit Tested - Card Reader 500 CPM

   1. Purpose of Test

      A. Initially determine the speed of the card reader per cycle and
         subsequently test all phases of timing to determine maximum time
         between various operations.

      B. To determine reliability of the card reader while reaching for
         maximumn time between various operations.

      C. To determine reliability of the card reader by causing the card
         reader to intermittently latch up.

   2. Method of Test

      A. Keys 1-6 are used to increment timing, between various operations.

      B. With keys 1-6 up, the card reader reads each record with normal
         programming delays.

      C. With sense switch 5 down, the card reader is intermittently
         latched up between records. Correct location 723 compare
         every word on the test card.

        5. Indicators

           An indicator 1 through 6 on indicates a corresponding key has 
           been depresses to determine the maximum timing of an operations.
           Indicator 7 on indicates the test has determined the speed of the
           card reader per cycle.

D. Normal Stops

   01146   No printer on line and maximum timing has been reached for
           all operations except the time between 12 right time and EOR.
   01147   No printer on line and maximum timing has been reached 
           between 12 right time and EOR
   05517   Enter control word in keys to indicate testing the card reader
           and the number of channels on line.  At this stop, test cards
           are to be reloaded in the card reader if more then on pass
           is desired.

E. Error Stop

   06545   Word read from card and word in storage did not compare 
           correctly.

F. Print-Outs

   1. Program identification is printed out initially if a printer is on
      line on channel A.

   2. After 300 records have been read by the card reader, pass compete is
      printed out if a printer is on line on channel A.

   3. Test cards are punched to indicate which word failed in a comparision
      error.  The decimal sum of every 2 octal digits equals the word.
      The zero row is indicated by the decimal sum of 10.

      Examples 9 Row  9L 727272727272 9R 27272727272
               0 Row  0L 737373737373 0R 37373737373

   4. See the page following the constant-delay time tables for examples of
      all printouts.

G. Comments

   1.  See page 1 of the listing for instructions on how to enter keys for
       testing of card readers on a single or multiple channels.

   2.  To determine the maximum timings between various operations with
       no printer on line on channel A, display XRB or location 02254 and
       consult the constant-delay time table for the timing comparable to
       the value in XRB or location 02254. *Note* If sense light 3 is on
       when determining the time btween rows, add six octally to the value
       in XRB or location 02254 and constult the constant-delay time table
       for timing between rows.  Sense light 3 is turned on only if maximum
       timing between rows occurs between 11 row right an 12 row left.

   3.  See 9C01A program for flow chart.

   4.  Six words on a test card are compared: 9L, 7L, 5L, 3L, 1L, 11L.
       A complete card cannot be compared if keys 1-6 are down.

   5.  In order to compare the complete card, change the decrement of
       location 723 from 4 to 1.
